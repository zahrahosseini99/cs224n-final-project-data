...we came in?

[Verse: Roger Waters]
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
Tell me, is something eluding you, sunshine?
Is this not what you expected to see?
If you wanna find out what's behind these cold eyes
You'll just have to claw your way through this disguise

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Lights!
Roll the sound effects!
Action!
Drop it, drop it on 'em
Drop it, drop it on them!

*Baby Crying*

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you, the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You'll slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice",1979,0,Pink Floyd
"[Verse: Roger Waters]
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me?
All in all, it was just a brick in the wall
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall

"[Intro: Roger Waters]
You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddie!

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children in any way they could (Oof!)
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kid

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
But in the town, it was well known, when they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives",1979,0,Pink Floyd

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control

All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

Wrong, do it again! (*Children playing*)
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!

Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?

Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh-ah, Mother, should I build the wall?

Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true

Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm

Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall

Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Day after day, the love turns gray
Like the skin of the dying man
And night after night, we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older, and you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV? Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat? Would you like to learn to fly?
Would ya? Would you like to see me try?
Ah, no!

How could you go?

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Breakdown]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you
Out there on the road, always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to (Fly to... fly to... fly to...)

Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone

Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon

Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone

Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall
(Against the wall)
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall

And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon!

With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart

With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!

Showing feelings of an almost human nature

The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate

Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!

All alone, or in twos

Some kind of James Brown or something in between
But when I ask for money you smother me in charms
I can't live on glory when your bendin' both my arms

And man I had friends for miles around

What good's a lion Lord, without a crown

You're living in a cave man ,upon your marble throne
You think you own the heavens, but you've got to be alone
You know I prayed for sunshine, a woman with my name
I don't want to live man, you gave away the game

When people sang and poems rhymed
My name could be Napoleon

A thousand ships, a windy sail
So huge and high, it's tall enough to touch the sky
It's beautiful but hard to find
But I just wasn't born in time

Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

I can dream of growing trees
And things that live and grass that's green
In meadows that have never been
But I still place my trust in the Queen

What is life when a man is pressured
Based on wrong or right?
And I don't know what it means
There must be more we haven't seen

When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground

"Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people

Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it

To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?

Still, you don't regret a single day

Ah, girl

She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her

I wish that I could work it out

Storm-lord, the Dreaded One
Poison of our worlds
In times of darkness, of death and decay
He grasps dominion all over
His stench hovers as shame

A profane blasphemy of the darkest atrocity

Welcome me, mortal beings
To a world a cry of fear
Incursions to evil
Shattered are your dreams
My breath, a torrid wind
Of immortal pestilence

Drowning in the stygian sea

Remember you must die

A gratuitous wraith of violence
Blots out the light of my mind
For on this night someone must pay
For the cost of my life

For me to escape the curse of perdition
This poor, weaker being must receive pain
As you wince at the actions of my sadist ways
And cry at the throes of your moribund state

A Daemon issues your last rites

I break, I twist, I burn, I destroy

As the candle of life, that burned in your heart

His spirit will live eternally
Take his life, by your command
A sacrifice, by your command

As I rise from my troubled sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep
Wondering if he has chosen me to do his work, I speak no blasphemy
Do I confess? I am terrified, I cannot run, there is no place to hide
I search for help, but there's nobody there for my dream is now a recurring

Understand my plight, help me fight this curse that bestows me

So that night I did dream of mysteries untold
In the presence of the heavens was I
I could see for myself all the evils of the world
In all their morbid glory

The beast they call ""The Evil One""
As voices in my head did tell me of my task

Hard enough that I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an avenue, chew an off street and off block

Give them a punch of the funk
Knock all of their gold tooth loose (Pow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on, you can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of ten
Then one, two, three, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit' your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk, pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock

While I pour lyric funk down your brain, punk

Of two-tens
Not from an oven, but MAC-10

Too hard to handle

Stick 'em up, stick 'em up! I got the jammy to your guts, punk
Don't make a move! Before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block, 'cause my stomach's in a knot
And it growls twenty-four hours a day around the tick-tock
I got roaches and rats up the back, carryin' bats and gats
So I *farting noise* 'fore I snack, Jack
I guzzle it down with water from the hydrant

I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I haven't had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squad up, 'cause I'ma set up this kid
Carryin' loot out from Burger King and what I'ma do is...
Run up on him, snatch the bag of money, then bust the dummy!
'Cause, my man, when I think of a plan, there's no shorts take
'Cause I pack jammies inside of my North Face, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am 'cause the man's a pure pro
(Yo, my man you got a light? [Straight jackin']
Yeah, give me the effin' money too, G!)
Yo, STOP, STOP, STOP!
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well, so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag, it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
'Cause I was set up, now I have to go head up with the cops
But they carryin' black Glocks (Shit's thick!)
What's my next move? My life's on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on, once again it's on
I fell (OW!) and then the black Glocks went (POW!)
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing I'm sniffin' is dust, because it's...

In the 4Runner, blastin' my tape, puffin' ganja
Since Erick got props
I stepped to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that baby cakes was hawkin' me
So I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific
Not knowin' she was scopin' me 'cause I was MAD splifted
Later on that week, honeydip freaked the funk
Playin' Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin' him weekdays, callin' me weeknights
(Who had her weekends?) Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
(No hats? Damn, black) The Funkadelic
Took a splash — you know how that go, fellas
Two months later (See you later, alligator)
She was pissed and I ended up seein' my physician
She took a blood test, she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin', ""Why the hell he isn't dead yet?""
Then I asked her, ""Why you lookin' at me?!""
She said, ""Redman, because you have the HIV""
Called Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!

And to my sisters, make 'em wear they prophyl-lastic

Think I'm dying for a piece of butt? Honey, you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss, so pucker up

And if it's beef, I'll punch you in your mouth, kid ('Damn!')
I got a heart but my heart is made out of nails
Word to Jamelle, my heart pumps nails in my blood rail
I'm not a warrior or barbarian type of nigga
I'm just quick to smoke your family then fuck your sister
That's what type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Been thinkin' about playing that nice guy role at heaven door
'Cause ever since I was an infant I was different
Paid no attention to my moms when she riffed-ed
I was a hardheaded mother-eff, but had to step
'Cause she hit me with a left, then another left
That's why my brain is out of order
Because it takes just a quarter to manslaughter your little daughter
And do a driveby—fuck that, I walk by and I spray shit
Then carve my name in your pavement
I was Rated 'X' but I flexed
I beat up the devil with a shovel so he dropped me a level
Ain't that ill? That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill
From a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill
Just because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit

I had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck
Tried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with an uppercut (BING!)

Since he dresses like his mama, I pimp him and his hoecake
Bust a maneuver, Freddy Krueger
Dreamed about me havin' him scooped up
He woke up with his dukes up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut 'em off, I truncate
And rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up
With the one-two punch, like serving a customer
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I know, from me, THE original P-Funk

And a clip on my hip, money-grip, no bullshit
I tic-tac on small cracks I'm all that to fall black

It gets me where I'm going, until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix

To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, yeahhh, I'm feelin kinda so-so
I dog you like Toto, make Rudolph nose glow
Funk out of sight with the type of hype
To make you say, umm, a 'Dyn-o-mite!'
Chiller, chiller than the Ice on Vanilla
I kill more kills than the quils from Tequila
I'm down with the green-eyed brother named Erick
Charlie, how you rate this? (Hmm, ten like Bo Derek)
I'm deeper than a valley, peace to Cool V and Sally
PMD, my man Solo, and I'm auuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudi...

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Ev-everybody get up!""
""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)
""Get on up!""

[Verse 1]
""Get down, get down, on down..."" like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I ""Get on up!""
Rhythm and funk makes you hump
Like Technotronic, I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
""Du-na-da-du-duh!"" without eating my damn spinach
'Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
""to chill..."" round off backflip cartwheel
""Ahhhhhh, you're nasty!"" I know
When my afro grow, that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E, what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

""I just want to jam for you"" (repeat 2X)

Check this out here, let the rough cut cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew, I'm twenty-two, and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
'Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a buh-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-don-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
'Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... on your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O-
-Wens with the Benz, I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin'
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E, what's that funk mode? ""Get on up!""

Ah, look out, it's the Funkadelic funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The top notch of the block, 'cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is hummin', comin' at ya, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher, ""Red, get freaky to the rapture""
So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check a-one, two
It's you, who? Redman with the kung fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the rough neck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables, I roast your whole record label, kids
Yo E (What's up, G?)

And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby

[Verse 2]
I do the hustle like Russell, Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom, makes me poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra, pop more pop than Coca-Cola
Next to Yoda, I'm a star at war, plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up, girl
Come on and get it if you with it, troop
Krush groovin' smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, 'cause I'm cautious about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real, punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean
저리 가 비켜라 몰라 가라
누구냐? 나다 나 나는 Redman
나보다 잘난~ 내~ 누구~ 나도~forget it
I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind (Rewind)

And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I—)

Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman
And I hit ya with the Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectacular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Load up a course more legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can wax on, wax off like Daniel-san
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to Herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama

Renegade rapper, rip when it's rhyme time
Punk push a pen and pencil when I'm pissed
Pack Pistol Posse, flow some more pro shit
Fee-Fi-Foe-Fum, funky to floor, ay
Fuck ya freak words for foreplay
Quickly, quiet is kept, never quack
On the Q-Tip I quote, I throw lines like a quarterback
A monster, murder motherfucks like Manson
A madman, who mutilize men with 9-M-M
Bullets blow bad, brother back to back I slam
Bread and butter, break beats to Bam Bam
Jump off the jim before I jack my johnson
I jam like Janet, chew MC's like Swansons
Dennis stamp dummy, I'm diggin a dungeon
Can you dig that I dig deep, to destroy dumb-dumbs?
Yes, I yam what I yam when I jam, bro
My afro's in the house (YO YO YO!)
Long as I live large, life will be luxury
Ladies in Lamborghinis, love is like luck to me
Nasty nigga, competition is none
From Newark, New Jersey, knock heads like Mike Nunn
Shit, grab the steel when I'm strokin
Smoke with shotguns but the sign said no smokin

"[Intro: Redman & Hurricane G]
Mic check, I can get smooth to any groove
Relax the tongue, let my mic take a cruise
Around the planet, pack 'em in like Janet
Jackson, she's askin' if I can slam it, I'm—
Yo, yo, Redman, man, what the fuck, man?
Get the fuck off that punk smooth shit, man
Get with that rough shit, man, you know how we do

[Verse 1: Redman]
Mic check, I walk around the streets with a black TEC-9
By the waistline, kickin' the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But have to show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that, the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat, son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo, bust the slang, what my name?
It's the Redman on the funk train
Psych, you're motherfuckin' right, tonight's the night
To do what I wanna do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been injected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk, pass the forty and the blunt and don't front
On the block, 'cause when you do front, brothers are gettin' stomped
I'm not an addict, more like Puff the Magic
Then pass it when I'm through 'cause my crew (Gots to have it)
I don't claim to be a big rap star
'Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin'
'Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggas ain't playin'

[Interlude]
Fat black bitch, nasty
Bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch
With them nasty Africans, Mr. Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin' ass
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker

[Verse 2: Redman]
You wanna see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
'Cause the lyrics and tracks make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smooth shit, I get down with the boom bip
Like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoes kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike 'n' Ike's
Hanging out with my niggas, my niggas
The Pack Pistol Posse keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the forty between my lap, coolin', rollin' down the highway
Blunt system pumps 'cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
'Cause we can do that black, so ""Get the Bozack"", Jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin' out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bump
Ba-bump, make your speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
But if you wanna see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic more slicker than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smooth shit
'Cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggas fucked up by lettin' me make an album (How come, rude boy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin' style run

[Interlude]
Nasty fuckin' green thumb Jolly Green niggas
Tango mango, pickin' havin' ass
Nasty epileptic disease crazy havin' ass
Johnny Cash, afro havin'
Jack of Spades, boots havin'
Tony Danza, shoes wearin' ass

[Verse 3: Redman]
B-b-b-black by popular demand, I expand
My hand to the mic and let my mouth kick the flim flam
I get sex, I get wreck, I puff mad blunts
I get vexed, I break necks, punch out gold fronts, chump, you—

Only hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props

So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the checka one, two
It's you! AHHHHHHHHHHH! Funky fresh in the flesh, troop
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the roughneck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables, I roast your whole record label, kid
Yo, Red! (Whassup, G?) Briiiiiidge!

""Ooh, you blow my mind""
""All around the world for the funk""
""On and on and on and on""

Look out...AHHHHH!

[Verse 2]
Can I tear the roof off this mother? It's the Funkdafied brother
Then I laugh, because I burn ya like Backdraft
So call the fire engine 'cause I'm flamin' up your buildin'
One life to live, so the funk is in all my children
'Cause I can get wicked like the witches from Eastwick
And freak the type of funk to make all y'all teeth grit
And crumble, my style is more flyer than the Brundle
Fly from The Fly part one, The Fly part two
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean

"[Verse 1]
I get mad wicked (fuck around) and catch a bad one by the funker
I puff the mad spliffs and roll blunts with Archie Bunker
'Cause my brain is twisted, so I cock the biscuit
'Cause shit's thick, some say I'm a bastard of a swift bitch
Negro, funkin' it with the style in your ear, bro
To make you fear me like Cape without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy, so funky that you have to douche me
You can't hear me then my record label didn't push me
I know I'm sayin' 'funk' too many times in my rhymes
But if I wasn't that, I wouldn't freak it in the line
But it don't seems to matter 'cause my shit get fatter and fatter
I'll do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
With the bass in your trunk, weed laced with the blunt
I puff, I never got snuffed, bust while I dust your monkey
Ass off then I just crush on the hush hush
So if you want a taste of the funk from the gutter
Ask the brothers (Why?) 'Cause I'm bad (Word to mother)

And listen to the incredible shit that I kick my man
Give me five on the backhand then stick
Your finger in a hole and chop the stick quick
'Cause my lip get to the point, to STILL rock the fly shit
Since you're holding your breath, I hold my jewels
I swing hardcore, so I walk, holdin' my tools
The original P-Funk, takes no junk, from a chump, or punk, G
I been this way every since nine months
So get down while I rip the raps from my lip 'cause
My shit's more deep than any tape from Enigma
The gettin' nice, thinkin' killer brother who pop trash
Basic instinct — I'm a shooter so they got blasted
Much ass I kick, groove to the master mix
My song still pumps when it's not even mastered, bitch!
My shit's very chronic so rewind it
'Cause it's like.. eh-eh-eh-eh beyond, bionic!
'Cause I'm a wild and crazy guy! No lie!
Last brother to battle me I started pissin' in his eye
I'm bad, word to mother, to the motherfuckin' Hubbard

Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww SHIT!!
Check it out
Yo, 1992 begins a new wave for the blunt rollers
You know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the Phillie Blunt continues
The flava's the P-Funk y'all, get wit it
Check it out...

[Verse 1]
Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit, let's see if you're down with this
It's about strictly trying to roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll carry more blunts than Archie Bunk'
First of all, you get a fat bag of ism
From Uptown, any local store sells the shit, friend
Purchase a Phillie—not the city of Philly, silly punk
I'm talking about the cigar, the Phillie Blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Phillie Blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use your fuckin' fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion, then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit your lighter if ya gotta
The results, mmmmmmmm....proper

[Hook]
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt

Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up, yeah

[Verse 2]
The second paragraph might makes you laugh
When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smells like pure ass
That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him
'Cause his breath has the dragon in the dungeon
(Yo, yo, yo, light the blunt. uh yo, here's the lighter..)
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with your spit, shit
I dunno what dick or last puss' you licked quick
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females
That always fucks it up 'cause they don't wanna break their Lee nails
(hee hee hee hee hee, sorry Red for spilling it...)
[BEEEITCH] You better pickup every seed of it
Because I paid 10 bills for the get ill
And for spilling it, you better get lost or get grill
Bo know everything from sports to other stuff
But I bet you Bo don't know to roll a blunt

[Hook]
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt

Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I was out for lunch and shit, puffin' on a blunt to get my head wrecked
Boogie'n to my Walkman with an ""S"" on my chest
(Bust a move!) Yes, I'm a superhero, don't forget
I smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes
But anyway, let's get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am, so git off that ol' bull-
Shucks! Lunchtime was up—FUCK!
Let me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks
On the way back, Jack, I spotted this object, a stray cat
Stuck in a tree, with a tag that says that:
""If found, please return to this address""
(How did you see it?) Nigga, with my X-ray eye set!
Like ""Pchoooooooww"", I jetted to the closest phone-booth
Quick flash, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...
(Johnny 'Guitar' Watson: I can leap tall buildings...yeah...
In a single bound...)
Boom! Right through the fuckin' phone booth ceiling
(It's a, it's a plane!) Nah, Sooperman Lover's the name
I can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains
On a mission, to save this cat that was wishin'
He was in his litter, watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n
Relaxin', feet cocked up, just a little
With a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles
I snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'
Then landed at the cat's tag address in the projects
(Elevator's broken!) So I had to take the back steps
(Knock, Knock) The door opened then my eyes swole
From this badass honey sippin' a quart of Old Gold
""Yo, is this your cat?"" ""Awww, yes! Where'd you find him at?""
""He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan""
""Well, how the hell did you save him? Are you police undercover?""
""Naw baby the ""S"" on my chest stands for""

[Hook]
Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong...
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...

[Verse 2]
She was grateful, lookin' for ways to repay me
No money, a donut, and some..uhm coffee maybe?
""Of course, what kind to show that I thank ya?""
""Make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka""
We sat, unhooked the cape from my back
She felt my arms 'cause my pythons looked stacked
""Goddamn, Sooperlover! Yo shit look thick
Tell me, how strong are you with muscles like this?
You bad motherfucker!"" (I'm stronger than a locomotive)
Akhi hit ya like Rocky
She dashed to the room and came back with an ounce
Negligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up, hey hold up, she had the dollar fold up
To mix the coke with the smoke, yo, she was no joke
She took a sniff, some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick
And said: ""Here baby, hit it."" ""Naw baby, I ain't wit' it
You'd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit!""
But I'll hit the blunt, so she took out her fronts
Cracked the Phillie, opened the bag, and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull, it was hype, oughta sight
She ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later, tossed the cover and, oh brother, I was wit' it
Ready to hit it asked my dick (Yo, wassup, G?)
Yo, man, shit's thick
Licked her on her belly then kissed her down her back
Stuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack
As big as mine (Ewwww!) This bitch must be craze
So I threw my suit on and I was Swayze...
'Cause I'm the

Inspires affection
It's queer

In her direction

The girl is naked
The boy is naked
He hides
Inside
A secret chamber
There to gape
Through a velvet drape
And dream of rape

Her sharp suggestion
He couldn't get an erection
Came as a shock
He finds himself
A laughing-stock
His ageing fate
To contemplate

His revenge is his story
What he will write
Will recall the bite
Of his wit
And legendary appetite

Creates the myth and vindication
Of his sexual vocation

His lives and lovers and above all
His erection

"[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable?
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
""There's no way we're gonna give up"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
She said, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

And does it kill? Does it burn? Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill? Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?

You'll understand what I mean when I say

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)

Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied till I'm under your skin

Immobilized by the thought of you
I'm paralyzed by the sight of you
I'm hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe 'em anyway

Remember how my body tastes

Fresh dirt under my fingernails

And trying to recreate

But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through

And we're only several miles from the Sun""

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

[Outro]
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go

You would come around
But no, no, no
I'm not thinking that way

You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me

I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again

Pretending to feel the same

"[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!

[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts""
(Don't break no hearts!) (Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)

[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!

[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! (Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

[Outro]
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breakin' my heart, babe
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

"[Intro: Child]
Think about the generations and say that we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they, they, they know it's a better world for them, and think, if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
To make a better world

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Would this Earth crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!",2008,1,Michael Jackson
"[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
(Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
(Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!

"[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
""Come go with me"", I said, ""I have no time"" (Hee-hee!)
She said ""Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone"" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said ""You know my name""
(You know my name!)
""And don't you pretend you never did me before""
(Don't you, don't you, baby!) (Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee! Hee! Hee! Hee!)

[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

Hee-hee!
Oooh!
Oooh!
Hoo!

[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!) (Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Dog gone!) (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Woah!) (Oh, yeah!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee! Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hoo-hee! Hoo!) (Dog gone!)

"[Verse 1]
There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Bridge]
Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that

[Chorus]
We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Come on, yeah
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Oh yeah, we got it
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom

"[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

"[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)

[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! (Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! (Yeah, make that change)

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine m-m-m

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

I love you more than he

Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To one's town

But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare

You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, ""I love you so, I'll never let you go""

Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, ""I do""
""I do""
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, ""Hey, Farewell"" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do",2008,1,Michael Jackson

Then let me take a bite

Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shomon, then, Shomon!
Watch
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that

[Verse 1]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See)
And I finally found, come on, girl

[Chorus]
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I own I give (Come on, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 2]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
(Whoa oh oh)
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right (Whoa, girl)

[Chorus]
You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Oh)
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)

And girl, I know that this is love
I feel the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to me, baby, yeah)

"[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 1]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
It's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life",2008,1,Michael Jackson
"[Verse 1]
Once, all alone
I was lost, in a world of strangers
No, one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You, suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now it's all clear
You, took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are my life

[Verse 2]
Now, I wake up, every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
‘Cause you love me
You, help me understand
That love is the answer, to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime

[Bridge]
You gave me strength
When I wasn’t as strong
You gave me hope, when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes, when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting, for me

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime

You make me shine
Or more like the stars

When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf

If you called out loud
Would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis?

And you can say the words
Like you understand

Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a, little self-esteem

Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off’n the ground

And when ya think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone?

And you can go by the feel
‘stead of circumstance

So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take
Will get you there
If you’ll only try

Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize

Dust off your butt
And get your self-respect back

To know that I don't play
Take it like you wanna

I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul

And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself

Did she find in someone else?

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?

Somebody hurt my soul, now

I am the dead
I am the agony inside

This is injustice
Woe unto thee

Would have mercy on me

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood
I've never known

Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask
Have you seen my Childhood?

People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known

Living like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain and you know I know my part

On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I am never alone because I have got myself

She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smelling sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried

In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big, you know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home

I said, ""Nice boys don't play rock and roll""
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy

Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price laying flat on her back

Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made

Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was

Hot for kicks just to get her ass around

It ain't easy living like a gypsy
Telling you, honey, how it feels
I've been dreaming, floating downstream
And losing touch with all that's real

Never knowing where you been, oh yeah
You've been fading, always out parading
Keep in touch with mama kin
You always got your tail on the wag
Spitting fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out 'cause someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon

It isn't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is

And working for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans

And working for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon

[Chorus 3]
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and sucking me, oh no, no, no, yeah",1986,0,Guns N’ Roses
"Last time I saw him
He sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him
He said:""I'll be back for more of this""
Last time I saw him
We were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving
But he had to set us up

I gave him money
I know I invested well
Mamma doesn't trust him
But he loves me I can tell

Arrives at nine o' clock
But I don't start my crying
'Till that last man's gotten off

Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
But I'm still waiting here
Without a fear
That bus will someday turn around

I had no letter
It's been six months, maybe better
I try forgetting him
But I love him more then ever

I have decided
I've waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong
He would return right on that bus

There must be trouble
So I'm leavin' on the double
If he can't get to me
I know he needs me desperately

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry

Who has been a lady so long
So long that her cloth is wearing thin
A momma unwed, alone in her bed

Love alone won't set her free

What good is a word said to the man
Who doesn't hear
What meant to be heard
The voice of her child cryin' in fear
His hunger inside
She can't feed with pride

She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

She went down to the country
To find a wishing well
But the country had gone to the city
And the city had gone to hell

She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way

But that was many, many years ago
Abandoned in a pile of useless junk
I found her never to be lost again
While I'm around her
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old funky clothes
We don't care if folks are laughing
When we're on the road
Can't you feel that surge of power
Going 18 miles an hour
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
She ain't even paid for but she's mine I suppose
Once they tried to repossess her
But she wouldn't start
God bless her
Spunky hunk a junk my funky rolls
For 30 years she got by on her looks
That was chic, that was very chic
Her face appeared in all the motor books

Once a week each and every week
When they checked her gasket out
The old girl blew it
Funky was a lemon
She never knew it
But I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
She's got Plymouth headlights and
A tank full of holes
Once I thought I really lost her on Cid Boulevard
Funky found the love she needed
Metaphor, overheated
I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old, old funky clothes

Break me up, I'll see you later

Where did we go wrong
How could life give us love, then take it away

Alone again today
Remembering when

We were a brand new morning
We weren't afraid to feel
All that we asked was somewhere to hide

We were like happy children
Reaching out to touch everything that's real
We believed in love 'cause our lives were touching inside

And baby, remember the things we needed
The summers and the winters and springs we needed
The feeling we would fly and on wings we needed to share

Remember the people how few we needed
We always had the me and the you we needed
If every little thing that we knew we needed to care was there

Then where did we go wrong
And isn't time supposed to heal me?
Where did we go wrong
And can a part of you still feel me
As much as yesterday
A touch a world away
We were the time of Crystal
Shining for love to see
Both of us gave the things we receive

We were like hungry people
As I gave to you so you gave to me
Believing in our love 'cause we love the things we believe

Baby, remember the dreams we needed
The nights we couldn't sleep and these dreams we needed
So we could find the time for what it seems we needed to say

Remember the touches to show we needed
To keep our love and keep our love the glow we needed
And being here without you I know we needed to stay
That way

I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong

I ask the Lord, ""Help me find the way!""
Help me find the way to the promised land
This lonely body needs a helping hand
I ask the Lord to help me please find the way

When the new day's a dawning, I bow my head in prayer
I pray to the Lord, ""Won't you lead me there?""
Won't you guide me safely to the Golden Stair?
Won't you let this body your burden share?
I pray to the Lord, ""Won't you lead me please, lead me there?""

When the judgment comes to find the world in shame
When the trumpet blows won't you call my name?
When the thunder rolls and the heavens rain
When the sun turns black, never shine again
When the trumpet blows, won't you call me please, call my name!",1962,0,"Peter, Paul and Mary"

"I am a man of constant sorrow;
I've seen trouble all my day
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised

All through this world, I'm bound to ramble
Through storm and wind, through sleet and rain
I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll take the very next train

Your friends they say I am a stranger
You'll never see my face no more
There is just one promise that's given
We'll sail on God's Golden Shore

"You read about Sampson, you read about his birth
He was the strongest man that ever lived on Earth
One day old Sampson was walking alone
He looked down on the ground and he saw an old jaw-bone
He lifted up that jaw-bone and he swung it over his head
And when he got to moving ten thousand was dead

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down

Sampson and the lion got in attack
Sampson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion - he killed a man with his paw
Sampson he got his hands around the lion's jaw
And he ripped that beast till the lion was dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had lovely looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she climbed up on Sampson's knee
And said ""Tell me where your strength lies, if you please""
She talked so fine, she talked so fair
Sampson said ""Delilah, cut off my hair
Shave my head just as clean as your hand
And my strength will be like a natural man.""

"When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me
""Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree.""
""Don't put your faith in love, my boy"", my father said to me
""I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree.""

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me:

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day she left without a word. She took away the sun
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you:

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat",1962,0,"Peter, Paul and Mary"

I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May

Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do
Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May

Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May

Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie

Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go ""BOOM BOOM!"" and yo' guns go ""pow pow""
I'm known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques
I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is bond, I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn!
C'mon, put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, represent, put it on, C'MON!

[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
(You don't know?) you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me? Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella, put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, represent!
Put it on, c'mon, put it on!

Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy, you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moët, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella put it on and onnn!
Big L, you gotta put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L put it on ond on!
Word up, knahmsayin?
My man Big L, runnin' things for the nine-four
And nine-oh-s, you know what I mean?

"[Verse 1]
Ayo, spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend? A'ight, then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah 'cause I got all of them sprung, Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them, they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C

Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance, Jack, to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

Battles, I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill)

"[Verse 1: Big L]
Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother's tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
All the ho's gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losing all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and out of luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Verse 2: Big L]
Girls of the nineties ain't nothing but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leaving brothers for the next man 'cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours, but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes selling jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was taking 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke, the girls stopped speaking
'Cause nowadays girls want you to trip
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey

If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins

If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Verse 3: Big L]
I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a. gold digger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss, but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz, I'ma break it down like this

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

It's like that y'all and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm living swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all
If you don't got ends, girls be fronting
If you don't got ends, they ain't giving up nothing
If you don't got ends, all the girls ignore you

Yo, my crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless

And I'mma set it like this

[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin' this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go berserk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, 'cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

[Verse 2: Terra]
Well, I'm flave, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, 'cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas gotten props to swallow nuts

[Verse 3: Herb McGruff]
For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff and when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise
Break bones, then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease, ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?) Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from Hell, I'm the fuck up outta here

[Verse 4: Buddah Bless]
Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood, I'm servin' brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
'Cause I'm no maricón, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice and cold take a fag's life
My swellin' melon got niggas jealin'
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin' niggas lives like a felon

[Verse 5: Big Twan]
Yo, I'm bustin' chumps like a Glock 10
When I drops in, the top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill your show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail, dig
Yeah, and I'm nasty, too nasty to trash me, bash me
Aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that's sawed-off
But when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
You dissin', you'll come up missin' like a cub scout

[Verse 6: Killa Kam - Cam'Ron]
Rappers be funny like Fletch
'Cause they sections say they slaughter, son
Talk about nines and TECs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease 'cause once I release
My crew from the East, we leavin' at least 20 police deceased
It's the beast on attack, so make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black MACs
On Lenox Ave., ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

[Verse 7: Trooper J]
I'm havin' nail-sharp pains in my brain like a Hellraiser
I'm blazin' trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin' but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call 'em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein' heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

[Verse 8: Mike Boogie]
I should never rhyme 'cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones
And sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin' to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I don't need a gun for you, none of you
'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their motherfuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice 'cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a MAC-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm 'bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, aiyo, 8 is enough

[Outro: Big L]
True, true and before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin' in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew, word up",1995,0,Big L
"[Verse 1]
Yo, once again, it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
From killin' corrupt cops with motherfuckin' buck shots
So don't step to this, 'cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big, but they make coffins yo' size, too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga, we do walk-by's
No one can match me, tax me, or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps, G, just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin? That's idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS, every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than Swiss cheese

[Chorus]
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

[Verse 2]
I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone, chief
Or catch a buck shot to your dome piece
I must warn, I got it goin' on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin' thrown off platforms like PM Dawn
I'm catchin' bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggas, but hoes too
So don't try to test me, 'cause I can't stand testers
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man, you've been rappin' for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin' motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the get-go
Leavin' fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

[Chorus]
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

[Verse 3]
Yo, ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit 'em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin' snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'ma start rapin' bitches
I'm all about makin' papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole
So the next day, knocked on his door, and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin' on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style, I'm wild, comin' straight out of Harlem, pal
It's Big L, the motherfucking problem child

[Chorus]
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

[Outro]
This goes out to all y'all bitch-ass niggas!
So if your mother ain't ready for a funeral, don't fuck with me!
'Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I ain't talkin' bout a reunion, motherfucker!
Yo, I'm bout to sign out, but before I go
I gotta say peace to the NFL crew, you know who you are
And all y'all niggas talkin' that gun shit and won't bust a rhyme, stop fakin' the funk!
Word, I'm bout to get up out of here
Yo I'm out B, yo peace man
I gotta get this money
So all y'all niggas on my hit list get your suits ready

Sendin' poems to have them faggots
Diggin' hoes like Reverend Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps 'til they head splits
Then break 'em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' TEC's, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well, Big L's gonna burn in Hell

Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up
They said a real man won't hit a girl
Well, I ain't real, 'cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price
I'm the type to snap in Heaven with a MAC-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, 'cause Hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit strictly

Hoes be runnin' up, ""Can I get your autograph, L?""
No, bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin' hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge, just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers, bitch – if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold-slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Ayo, crazy bitches slept with L

"[Intro]
Yeah, it's the Big L
Coming at you once again, in nine-five
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown, and everywhere
Check it

[Verse 1]
Yo, where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
'Cause mad clowns be catchin' wreck with a Tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
Their life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks, and bust gats, and run the streets actin' violent
To them, it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (What?) 'cause they're street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

[Verse 2]
Before the rap contract, I was sellin' crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this, I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head, do your thing
But with the cash profit, make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars?
And yo, it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers, or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo, they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams, but gave 'em up 'cause they street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

[Verse 3]
I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time, I'm in the crib writing rhymes to some dope beats
Or either calling up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin' me, like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from, you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners, that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

Word up
Ayo take it from me, the Big L
'Cause I been through it all, you know what I'm sayin'?

Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A TEC-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
'Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me 'cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure

I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan

And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
'Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer

While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from

I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one

My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave. there's a big park
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats
That's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a muthafuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave. and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no muthafuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're getting stuck, jack
My moms told me to get a job, fuck that
Ayo, picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob, selling corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'mma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man, I'd rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin' connivin' muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasn't poor, I was po' - I couldn't afford the 'o-r'
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene, took his brand new ring
'Cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, ""Give up the dough, before you get smoked
Oh you're broke? *gunshots*
Now you're dead broke""
The Big L was cold crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

There are too many MC's who are overrated
You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress

Mic right, so take flight 'fore I bruise ya
For sayin' those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
Aiyo, I'm serious, Big L ain't playin' games
I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin' names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin' platinum and don't have no soul

MC's - what's goin on?
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged, you're not the same
Your raps are plain, that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Who's fault is that? Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make fat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same, and only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin' for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dap, stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin' beads?

This is how it should be done
I'm not the one, and my raps is strong like rum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb
Plus slum (How come?) Rap skills they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail, they're false like fairy tales
Your technique and everything you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Your raps border wack, and you went on tour with that
Crap, don't understand it, 'cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs, givin' MC's nightmares

Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good

Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay

Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin the other cheek
Or you'll be layin' in a pine box
Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm also fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep goin
Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip, the trigger I pull quick
Cause I'm fed up with that bullshit

[Hook]
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, I'm serious, I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black, never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze, I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well-writ
You sayin', ""L's this,"" and, ""L's that""—get off L' dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican, I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up

[Verse 2: Big L]
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
It's all about me, yo it's a B. I. G. L thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate, Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MC's be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing, cause every hero got a theme song

[Verse 3: Big L]
The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact, black, I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride, I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last, I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of dough, I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate, she gotta go!
When I was young I played with guns, not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a rough, rugged gangsta, not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike, but Mike wanna be like L

Outro [Ma$e]:
A-yo, big shots to all them niggas on the corner
Doin' something they ain't
Got no business doin'
I gotta say what's up to S&S, Doo Wop, and the Bounce Squad
Can't forget my peeps from Brooklyn, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like Box and Herb and Big Sid
A-yo, L, you must be buggin', B
You didn't even let me say what's up to my hoes, B

Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way

Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad 'cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And every time I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

Battles, I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you, honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill)

"[Chorus]
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

[Big L]
Ayyo, one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel, yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib, yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came, but one problem, she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean, cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin, watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes, tryin to get the puss'
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick, is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said, ""I hope you ain't tryin to dick tease
Ayyo, cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave.""
Ayyo my game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab, on 139 & Lenox
Ayyo, I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo, I'mma kill that bitch, the next time that I see her

[Chorus] x2
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system, lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max, and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank, she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said, ""Sweeheart whats your name?""
""I gotta man,"" ""I ain't ask you that.""
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch, I said, ""Fuck you bitch.""
Another girl walked by, I called her
""Excuse me what's your name"" ""Lorraine, what's yours""
Ayyo, game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont, but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said, ""L's for Lamont, but what's the Big for?"" ""You'll see.""
Ayyo, my pockets was extra thick
""So what you doin later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick.""
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel
And when it comes to this I'm a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting bolder
Cause I didn't put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a leak
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick

[Chorus] x4
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

Ayyo L these bitches be burnin’ the dog shit outta niggas, know what I’m sayin’?

Who you tellin’ man? These bitches nowadays’d have a nigga dick drippin’ lava

[Laughter.]

You know what I’m sayin’? Ayyo, these bitches’ll have a nigga, give a nigga’s balls a heat rash or somethin’ man

Okay…

Man fuckin’ with these hoes without a rubber nowadays is like bungee jumpin’ with a rope around your neck. That’s like playin’, [laughter], that’s like playin’ Russian roulette with a shotgun. Ayyo word, ayyo, ayyo man, fuck a rubber man, I’m a start puttin’ balloons on my dick, dog, ayyo I’m a start puttin’ suntan lotion on my dick or somethin’. Ayyo these bitches is triflin’ dog.

"Lovin’, tender sweeet as i remember
Feelin’ fires in your arms
Say we’ll last forever

High as a rainbow

Just us – just us –just us

Givin’ true my whole life through

Livin’ lovin’ in your arms

I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you

And happiness I've known proves that it's right

"When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose? The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Or maybe you know some little places to go
To where they never close, downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playing
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swaying
Happy again, the lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along, so maybe I'll see you there
You can forget all your troubles, just forget all your cares

And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now

To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise

Out on the new horizon

And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me running
Through the long abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing

Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder

Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown

Pretending that you're still around

Being me and a what I am
And what I am, I'm just a man

And I've sat in the sunshine in summers of sadness
And lived through the winter when lonely was here
And I've gone through the motions of feeling for fear
That I never would find you, my dear
And I'm thankful to whoever made it all possible
For me to be with you while I lived
And spare you the grief if I passed on before you
And I don't think I'd live if you died before me

On in the time when the roses are gone

Sometimes a song is funky

Sometimes a song is tender
Sometimes a song is sad
Maybe that evening that you wrote this song that's all the feeling you had
Sometimes a song just feels real good and lays right there in the groove
Sometimes a song might make you just wanna get up and move

Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song
It went a little something like
""Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn""
Momma why do they keep sayin' this? I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?

Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly-white, predominantly black. Well, what about me?
Where does that leave me? Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em

While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'? What do I look like, some kinda idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit? It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
""Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it. That little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it

Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale. I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on? This ain't what I chose to be
So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it

We seem to be approaching (C'mon!) an age of the gross (*Burp*)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each—and each generation should do a little bit better

All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place

I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like, ""White boys don't know how to rhyme.""
I spit out a line and rhymed ""birthday"" with ""first place""
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road

My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
""Exist in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!""
Now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
""You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!""
All I remember is meetin' back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the ""Ole Foolish Pride"" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a—

Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause—

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him! Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up
'Cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'Cause—

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on

"[Intro]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as ""I'ma whip someone's ass""
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

[Chorus]
So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr. Senator
Can you guys hear us?",2004,1,Eminem

*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
There I go, thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach

You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach

Oh! Yeah! So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
""Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said.""
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop? I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)

Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain? Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, ""Ni—""
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
""Ga-hu"" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', ""I'm gon—nuh cum!""

Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw the line or any fences
If so, to what extents, if any, should I go?
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chris-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those 25-cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super—
Man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is... Rain Man

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now in the bible, it says:
""Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
'Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly-known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?""
Let's ask Dr. Dre—Dr. Dre? (What up?)
I got a question, if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend? (Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off? (Yeah)
But— 'ut, I ain't done yet
In football, the quarterback yells out, ""Hut-hut""
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but, just, what if
It was never meant—it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in—
His teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay? I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain

Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame

My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 3: Eminem (Dr. Dre)]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive—shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop-ass canister
God damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat? (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good-at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic—yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can, and, zoom, I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit

'Cause I ain't got no legs

I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo? Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do

'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay? You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something? What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
""Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?"" You, sir, are on truth serum
""Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities""

You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say

When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this? This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot

Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean ""rap"" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me? Maybe gouge my eyes out? (Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl? What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, ""Save it, boy, we got you on tape""
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B. Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?) Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

"[Intro]
Ow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ""ass"" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, ""Get out, you bozo""
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying ""freeze,"" (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze? My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word ""pee-pee""
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go

"[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and—

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that? Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, ""Fuck a bitch!""
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: ""Do I love these hoes?"" — Nope!

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: ""50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50""
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, ""You have very nice lips.""
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit? (Ha-ha!)

"[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad! (Ha-ha!)",2004,1,Eminem
"[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (Oh shit)
What now, nigga? What now? What? Brewster Projects, nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?) Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
(Hey man) ...That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forgot my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Verse 2: Kuniva & (Eminem)]
(Kuniva, you alright?) These niggas is tripping (Where's Bizarre at?) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier, and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit, and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late!

[Verse 3: Swift & (Kon Artis)]
(I been trying to call you all day, motherfucker, where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile...what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with? They car?) With a gat, nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with!)
Man! (I swear!) And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, 3,000 and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah, I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again, I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps, looked up, and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although, I can't stay here to fight, 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right, bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (Bitch, bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

"[Intro: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Sh-sh-sh, Shady! Aftermath! Haha!
G-G-G-G, G-Unit! Haha!

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, it’s another club banger
Got ya' hangin’ on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Time’s up, game’s over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who’s got you goin’ crazy again
I’m a trend, I set one every time I’m in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you’re gone, you don’t come back (Oh!)
Too bad, you’re off the map now, radar can’t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playin’ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin’ and moanin’, whining and bitchin’
Sit and observe, listen, you’ll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we’re on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin’

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem, Dr. Dre & 50 Cent]
When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Get it crunk! Crunk! Crunk! Crunk!
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot, and jump
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don’t gotta' promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin’ off the hinges
We ain’t showin’ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin’?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, ’cause Doc left you all guessin’
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon’ have this motherfucker hoppin’ in a second (Bump, bump!)
That’s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
’Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn’t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That’s why we came to…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
50 Cent, come on!

[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It’s no secret, everybody know
When Dre’s involved, there’s plenty of money involved
And plenty honey’s involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
Let’s rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre’s about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin’ out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
So never say never ’cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that a…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
We came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Yeah, haha! Still Aftermath, 2006! And don’t worry about that Detox album, it’s comin’… We gon’ make Dre do it! Haha! 50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre! We ain’t leaving, let’s go, haha! Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out! Peace!

"[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right! They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money! I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been ""Bastard"", the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack (*click*)

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
(Shht!) I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans",2004,1,Eminem
"[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three!

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try? Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
""Someone else,"" problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more",2004,1,Eminem
"[Chorus: Eminem]
Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

[Verse: Eminem]
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand ""How to Rob"" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering ""Fuck Compton""
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya' don't stop",2004,1,Eminem

In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder

You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""

"Long days, slow waste
Sew lies, sow hate

So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams
No more

Long days, long days

And again he rides in
It's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish hunter
A thousand lies, cast from the throne of secrecy
Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust believer
Your body - a vehicle to house his disease

Pearls before swine, they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king, dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow
A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles
Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes, waiting
Spiraling judgment, provoked in the rains

This futile test drowned in the levee of deception
This futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgment
Heir Apparent",2008,1,Opeth
"Liquid is in your throat for hopeless delight
After all you fell in love with death
Life has aborted all you've had and all you became
The night is calling, you pray forth
A barren waste is your land
Crops, they were sown to die
This skin is a mirror, the eyes hollow with ignorance
Health runs from your lips
Sucked in and safe from the world of sleep

All years caring for a liar
The barren drift road is winding higher
You're a moth too close to the fire

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all

Fleeing your sorrows, pushing your spirit away
Sick of the weakness of the psyche
A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a saviour
And cries out, for the restless will also die
A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower

O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself
I wish you’d never come back for us to see the beckoning end

[Instrumental Break]

And the pride of a mother drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son
And the pride of a mother drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son

Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting so clear and so true
Overheard us talking",2008,1,Opeth
"[Verse 1]
I once upon a time carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye, a broken rhyme I'd underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

[Break 1]
Sorrow in me

[Verse 2]
Saw a movement in their eyes
Said, I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost, a passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

[Break 2]
Waiting to fail

[Keyboard Solo]

[Break 3]
Failing again

[Verse 3]
If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear, you've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you

*Distorted Laughing*",2008,1,Opeth
"I lost all I had (that April day)
I turned to my friends (nothing to say)
I wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I wallowed in shame

[Instrumental Break]

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promised to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why",2008,1,Opeth
"Will the children cry when their mother dies?
And in the autumn of their lives will they feel the same?

Uoy ees I, natas teews ym
Thginot kcab emoc, draytruoc eht no tuo
(Out on the courtyard, come back tonight
My sweet satan, I see you)

Her longing for me coming down like hail
Why did you leave me
Come here inside and tell me how
How in my final days
I'd find the rhyme

The light comes on, the signal for us to act out our lives
You wait beneath the white sheets and you wait forever
The light comes on
Your weakness storing trace on your arms
So I left you alone, we all left you alone

Yhw nosaer ruoy regnol on re'yehT
(They're no longer your reason why)

Lock the children away from harm
They're no longer your reason why
Seeking tenderness with a dagger
Skin is marked by the years of trials

You felt abandoned in a flock of friends
Singing praise for the dead
Awaited the face of the moon to ascend
And followed the sound in your head",2008,1,Opeth
"Two years in your hearts
One moment of doubt
Two lives torn apart
One second from now

Held him in your arms
Your fever subside
Always safe from harm
Kept demons inside

Still you always start running
Towards the light from the moon
Some way mother cried
Left us space here, left us space here",2008,1,Opeth
"Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Caused me to linger on a piece of text
Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
Then someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, ""Thank you""

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here",2008,1,Opeth
"The sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean

Sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean

Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

Cold wind blows
The gods look down in anger
On this poor child

Cold wind blows
Gods look down in anger
On this poor child

Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs",2008,1,Opeth
"När jag tänker på den ständiga resan
Genom livet
När det alltid känns som höst

Då vänder sej vinden sakta mot norr
Och blommorna dör
Det faller regn i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst

När jag vandrar på den steniga vägen
Genom livet
När det känns som jag bar på en sorg

Då gömmer sej solen sakta i moln
Och ordet är adjö
Snart faller snö i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst

Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst",2008,1,Opeth
"[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before

Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet? Good

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said, ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me

I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?

[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on

Flickered in my mind, only you

Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out

Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

We've got our problems
They're not so bad
Sticky situations always stop us from moving ahead
Just a civil feeling....and it feels so right
Where's the need for this indecision?
I don't really want to fight

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Verse 2]
I know nothing is perfect
I see the doubt in your eyes
You're asking me so many questions
I pray that you realize
You don't the meaning
And it hurts me to say
In these games where we hide our feelings
Our problems remain the same

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby

"[Verse 1]
I resign myself to a strange sensation
Of wanting somebody that I can't have
I wish I could believe you relieve my tension
By telling me something I want to hear
But you won't
Will you?

[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

[Verse 2]
I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't help the feelings that I found
Your sentimental touch fills my hear with elation
Are we gonna kick this off the ground?

So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't hide the feelings that I found
And you aren't gonna help me, are you?

I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, ""Oh, she's just being Miley""
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 3]
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs
(That you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down

My problem isn't that I miss you
'Cause I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you, whoa
I figured out
That you're nothing that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
That soon time will erase in my heart

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

[Verse 2]
Your problem's not for lack of trying
'Cause you do
It's just that you're at your best when you're lying, whoa-oh
Now you're standing here
And saying things you think I wanted to hear
But you've got it all wrong, I've already moved on, my dear

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

[Bridge]
When you're standing near me
I don't see so clearly
The feelings are still palpable
But when I take two steps away
It sheds some light on my day
Yeah, you can't go back, it's all in the past
Guess you got to laugh at it

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
And if there's some confusion
Let me tell you, you're just delusional, get a clue
'Cause people change, thank God I did
Thank God I did
Thank God I did

It doesn't mean I like you now

Fog in the air just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?

[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

[Verse 2]
Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I'm here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to fill inside with peace
Like you were here with me

[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

[Bridge]
Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eyes
Is when I need you most
And don't you know?

[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other

"Somewhere
A lonely girl lies weeping
A lonely man tries sleeping
But he's getting nowhere

Sometime
It may be close to morning
She thought she heard him calling
But there's nobody there

And somehow, somehow
He knows he's got to try

To hold on
Somewhere she's crying for him
Hold on
Someday her smile will call him
Hold on
There's someone out there trying for him
Somehow
Sometime
Somewhere

Somewhere
Again she sleeps alone
He is reaching for the phone
But he's calling no one

Oh Sometime
She's dreaming of her lover
It really can't be over
We've only just begun

And somehow, somehow
I know I've go to try

To hold on
Somewhere she's crying for me
Hold on
Someday her smile will call me
Hold on
There's someone out there trying for me
Somehow
Sometime
Somewhere

Hold on
Hold on

Somehow
Sometime

"Each time that I hold you, your eyes fill with fear
You can't lose control now, the price is too dear;
But love, I have heard you crying in the dark
And the tears on your pillow came bleeding, weeping from your heart;

Oh Sinner, you're losing all that you had
Your day is in pieces, your night has gone mad
And love cannot touch you, the search has no end
And the one you've forgotten was really your only friend...

Then your soul flies to Heaven
You reach out for me
But the door will not open
You've thrown away the key;
No the door will not open
You've thrown away the key...

Oh Stranger beware the life that you lead
Is filled with the warnings you can or will not read;
Your castle has fallen, it lies in the sand
I heard your voice calling, I thought I felt the brush of your hand...

Oh Gambler remember the love that you lend
Will never come back for the game has no ending;
The smiler is calling, your turn for the deal
And the aces keep falling with every spin of the wheel;

Then you gather your winnings
You're ready to leave
But the door will not open
You've thrown away the key
Oh there's no point in staying
So don't wait to see
For the door will not open
You've thrown away the key",1975,0,Chris De Burgh
"When the angry sky, opens up its mouth
And lays down a belt of rain from the north to the south;
Close your windows and close all your doors
And pray for those men who fall upon rocky shores

And when the hungry road, points its finger at your heart
And says ""Stranger follow me, I will show you where to start;""
Well don't make a move, to the left or the right, or them
Hounds are gonna get you, send you running, screaming through
The stormy night

And one windy night, a flickering light, caught the eye of
A passing angel as she was in flight; she came to the
Door, and there she saw a young soldier crying, as he
Lay dying from a wound of war

Then the angel of the Lord, took the form of a girl
And knelt by the boy and said ""I will help you to that other world
Oh rest your weary soul, lay your head upon my shoulder
Press your trembling hand in mine until this night is over
For that Devil wants you, but you are a soldier, and with a
Friend by your side there's no need to hide until the fight is
Over...""
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night

So if you need help, on a windy night, be sure to leave a
Candle burning so a friend can see the light; there may be a
Stranger come looking for you, and it may be an angel of the
Lord come to bring you better news;
On a windy night...
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night...
Oh hear me, hear me Lord, oh Lord on my windy night...
Oh Hear me Lord, oh Lord on my windy night",1975,0,Chris De Burgh
"Good morning, Blue Rider, and how was your night?
Did you meet a nice woman, did she make you feel alright?

I heard you came in from the country, looking for a good time
You walked round the hot spots, and you met some good friends of mine

Oh Mojo, come here, give my friend a glass of wine, strange flavour
That's right, it's a new recipe of mine- c'mon

Pull up a chair, I want you to hear
Have no fear and I'll tell you what goes on here

I pick people up off the roadside, and lift them high in the sky
There's no sense in walking on the wrong side, you gotta live before you die
Anything that takes your fancy, you can have for free
Wine, women and dancing, but you've got to sell your soul to me
'Cos once you are in, you'll never get out from Sin City, Sin City

Good morning, Blue Rider, and how was your night?
Did you get the best deal from your body, did she make you feel alright?
Well she did 'cos she's my friend...

"A new moon is laughing up there in the sky, but
My love is crying and I'll tell you why...

Crisis and confusion when she came along
Followed by delusion when I found out that I was wrong
She said ""Baby, we're cruising along on the crest of a wave,""
And I said ""Maybe, but baby I'm losing, and the only wave is
Goodbye...""

'Cos just when I'm starting to burn with desire
My blood's getting hot and the flame's rising higher
She says ""Goodnight""...
And leaves me on fire, and I'm so sorry my love
I gotta say goodbye, ooh, ooh

A new moon, a new tune, another song is coming soon
New moon, new day, another love is coming my way
She took my heart, and without a word she tore it apart, ooh
New moon, so bright, shine your light on me for the rest of the
Night...

Scenes of soft seduction, spinning through my head
Watching her deduction as I lay grinning on my bed
She said ""Honey, it's so moving, I can almost see our wedding day,""
And I said ""Funny, you'd better start grooving honey or the only move
Is away""...

And then she turned with that look in her eye
And I know that bad weather'll be here by and by
And sure enough, she started to cry, and I'm so sorry my love
I really gotta fly, ooh, ooh...

A new moon, a new tune, another song is coming soon
New moon, new day, another love is coming my way
She took my heart, and without a word she tore it apart, ooh

But she was high above me, there's only one thing to do
Bye baby baby bye bye little darling, and now she's flying blue
And I'm sitting down here by the riverside

Oh yea yea yea Ram bam bi doo ah... Ram bam bi doo ay..
Do you want to meet my sister, she's good for a drink or two
At forty-five smiles to the gallon she can watch the world floating
Through

Bring out your city rose, bring the dogs and the cats in the boot, yea
Yea yea
You don't need no shoes, you won't feel the blues

"There was a lonesome cowboy, who rode his horse all day
At night he slept in the moonlight, till he heard that midnight
Train...

And then that lonesome cowboy, looked up at the stars in the sky
""I will leave my land and my horses, on that midnight train I will
Ride

To the city, far across the plains
To that city, on that midnight train, here it comes
Choo choo choo... on that midnight train""

And then that lonesome cowboy, stepped into a bar
A pretty girl slid over nice and easy, ""Boy your money won't go far.""

She took him outside to an alley, he got dragged into a fight
And a bullet sent him dying, and he cursed that moonless night

In that city, far across the plains
In that city, he could hear that midnight train, down the line;
Choo choo choo... he could hear that midnight train

And now that lonesome cowboy is lain beneath the clay
His horses they're still waiting, for he is gone away;

Now if you think the grass is greener on the far side of the hill
All you cowboys, take it easy, there's no grass there at all

In that city, far across the plains
In that city, you'd better miss that midnight train, here it comes
Choo choo choo... you'd better miss that midnight train
Choo choo choo... that train is coming for you",1975,0,Chris De Burgh
"Where your love is, put your heart, guard these moments well
Where your dreams are, put your hopes, you know they will not fail you
When the sun rises in the morning, you will wake up and find her yawning
When the wind blows strong and cold, she'll be with you until you grow old
Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?

I would build a lovely house with satin green shutters, it would be lovely
The most lovely house in the world...
And I would sing a lovely song with you in my mind, and you in my eyes
The most lovely song in the world...
I would write it down on the wall, just for you, just for you;
And I would hold you in my arms for the rest of my days

When you're sad and feeling low, you're on your own with nowhere to go
Make believe that she is gone, play your guitar and write a song for her
Write down the words about how you cried when you woke up weeping
'Cos you thought that she had died, and you heard her breathing
Through your pain and you held her close and cried all over again;
Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?

And inside my lovely house with satin green shutters, there would be children
The most lovely children in the world...
And even when skies are grey, we would be happy, for we have love
The most lovely love in the world;
I would write it down on the wind, just for you, just for you;
And I would hold you in my arms for the rest of my days",1975,0,Chris De Burgh
"Flying, I thought I'd never learn that flying
I thought I'd spend my whole life trying
For flying is that ancient art of keeping one foot on the ground...

Lying, I thought I'd never keep from lying
I thought I'd lose it all by sighing
For lying is that ancient art of hiding words that will never be found

Crying, I thought I'd never stop that crying
I thought I'd always dream of dying
For crying is that ancient art of weeping rivers into the ground

Oh dying, I thought I'd never see that dying
I thought I'd spend my whole life flying
For dying is that ancient art of keeping one world turning round

Sighing, I thought I'd never keep from sighing
I thought I'd always be there crying
For sighing is that ancient art of breathing sadness all around

And trying, I thought I'd spend my seasons trying
I thought I could stop myself from lying
For trying is that ancient art of proving that the world is round

And he's wondering why, and he's saying ""Little singer
Why aren't you sleeping, why aren't you sleeping?""
Oh, the day is hanging heavy on my eyes, I guess the time
Has come to say goodnight...

And may your dreams take you travelling all night long
With an angel by your side when the wind blows strong
Oh stay away from that city, that sad and lonely place
I will lead you to the river, here's the door
And the key is turning round
Close the shutters, do not cry, there's a new moon in the sky;
Oh hold on to your love, until your time has come to say... goodnight",1975,0,Chris De Burgh

It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me, won't you let me know?

[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said peace could last forever?
An' in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
An' I don't want to hear no more

[Verse 2]
My hands are tied
For all, I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on, as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
An' all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

[Chorus]
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh? I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no, no, no
I don't need one more war
Ooh, I don't need one more war
No no no, no woah, no woah

You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say and you know

Prayers in my pocket, and no hand in destiny

Well, I jumped into the river too many times to make it home

"[Verse 1]
I came across a cache of old photos
And invitations to teenage parties
""Dress in white"" one said, with quotations
From someone's wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're young you find inspiration
In anyone who's ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said, ""We were never feeling bored

[Chorus]
'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end""

[Verse 2]
When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said, ""If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies""

[Pre-Chorus]
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

[Chorus]
'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

[Verse 3]
Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties

[Pre-Chorus]
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

[Chorus]
'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: ""Make amends""
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

And we were never being boring
We were never being bored
'Cause we were never being boring

"The telephone's not answered
So many times you'll call
For many different reasons
So many tears will fall before
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
So many fears will haunt you
Deny them or regret
Some men will make you want to
And you will not forget before
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
There's a story of a man who loved too much
He ended up inside a prison cell
You've got to want to give to get it
Or you could land up in the same suspicious hell
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)
Coincidence and patience
Will mend this fatal flaw
Though it may seem a long wait
Others have been here before
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
One day, when the phone starts ringing
You'll answer to the words you're longing for
No tears, no trade, no prison cell
Whatever you need, he will return more
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door

When the sun doesn’t shine
And a boy needs a girl
It's about getting out of a rut
You need luck
But you're stuck and you don’t know how

"I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain
I'm the kind of man you can't explain

True love is one thing I've been dreaming of
I give my love to you. And when I do
You are to me, the very deepest part of me

I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be

When you hurt me, then I become the night time
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for
Me to see the way I should

I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be

I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain
I'm the kind of man that you can't explain

I am the world
I am the world",1998,0,Bee Gees
"What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new mowed lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
Been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about these blues you say I've got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping so low
A pie in the face for being a sleepy beau deau

And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream'll last along into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may perk up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy",1998,0,Bee Gees
"Hush my darling , sleep my lover
There'll be rain till we run for cover
Lost in love in a world of strangers
Something only the Lord arranges

Oh my darling , now I found you
Want to live all my life around you
You're my light in a world of sorrow
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow

I just want to hold you forever , forever
Loving one another that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

Oh my darling , if you leave me
I lose the love that has always freed me
Not knowing angel , what's coming after
Never hearing you're golden laughter

Oh my baby , hearts like thunder
Can't escape from the spell I'm under
I surrender to all your treasure
Endless nights of pain and pleasure

I just want to hold you , forever , forever
Loving one another , that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

I just want to hold you , forever , forever
Loving one another , that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never

Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold nights

Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands

The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room

Another day to swing on clothes lines

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida & Björn]
The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?
(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)

I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?

Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?

You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me? S.O.S

"[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me

Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine?
Where did it go?
I just don't know
But still, my love for you will live forever

Hasta Mañana till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then

Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared?
Where did they go?
I just don't know
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you

I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

Mamma mia, here I go again

Yes, I've been broken-hearted

Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
""Bye-bye"", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
""Bye-bye"" doesn't mean forever

Mamma mia, does it show again

"[Verse 1]
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 3]
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?

Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion

I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it? I ask in all honesty

No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

[Verse 3]
Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die

Wrapped up in chains

I tried to resist
But succumb to the bliss

Now I'm caught on your ride
All my thoughts are entwined

Goodbye again

For you

"[Verse 1: Martin L. Gore]
Condemnation, tried
Here on the stand with the book in my hand
And truth on my side
Accusations, lies
Hand me my sentence, I'll show no repentance
I'll suffer with pride

[Chorus 1: Martin L. Gore]
If for h onesty you want apologies
I don't sympathise
If for kindness you substitute blindness
Please open your eyes

[Verse 2: Martin L. Gore]
Condemnation, why?
Because my duty was always to beauty
And that was my crime
Feel elation, high
To know I can trust this fix of injustice
Time after time

If you see purity as immaturity
Well, it's no surprise
If for kindness you substitute blindnеss
Please open your еyes",2014,1,Depeche Mode

Is simplicity best
Or simply the easiest?
The narrowest path
Is always the holiest

Suffer some misery

If you want my love

Man will survive
The harshest conditions
And stay alive
Through difficult decisions
So make up your mind for me
Walk the line for me

If you want my love
If you want my love

Idle talk and hollow promises
Cheating Judases and doubting Thomases
Don't just stand there and shout it
Do something about it

You can fulfill
Your wildest ambitions
And I'm sure you will
Lose your inhibitions
So open yourself for me
Risk your health for me

"Put your arms around me child
Like when you bumped your shin
Then you'll know I love you now
As I loved you then

Though you maybe trying sometimes
And I'll need you
And you're not there
You know I may get mad
And turn away
But you know that I still care

But you cannot ask for more
Than can come from me
I am older than you are
And one day you'll see

If I lose my patience with you
And I suddenly start to scream
It's only because I just want you to be
Everything that I see in my dreams

And I'd like to know it's there
The feeling that we have
When you know that you can come
Running to me
Whenever times are bad

Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have

Though you are growing older now
And I'm watching you grow
I know I make you sad sometimes
And I see your feeling show

But one day I'll look around
And you will be grown
You'll be out in the world
Such a pretty girl
You'll be on your own

And I'd like to know it's there
The feeling that we have
Knowing that you can come to me
Whenever you are sad

And I'd like to know it's there
The feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have",2015,1,Diana Ross

That'll bubble and foam
And in a flash
You will be home

He's the Wiz
He's the Wiz
He's the Wizard of Oz

It would be impossible to leave
Fantastic powers at his command

That I cannot hide
And I know I've tried
But it's turning me around

If I'm up or down
Or here or there

Maybe I'm just going crazy
Let myself get uptight
I'm acting just like a baby
But I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be alright

Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home

In a different place
In a different time
Different people around me
I would like to know of that different world
And how different they find me

And just what's a Wiz
Is he big, will he scare me?
If I ask to leave
Will the Wiz even hear me?
How will I know then
If I'll ever get home again?

Here I am alone
Though it feels the same
I don't know where I'm going
I'm here on my own
And it's not a game
And a strange wind is blowing

I'm so amazed
At the things that I see here
Don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be here

What am I doing here?

Come on and slide some oil to my knees
And let me see if I can bend

Slide some oil to me
I'm beginning to feel just fine
Slide some oil down my throat
And let me lubricate my mind

Slide some oil to me
Go ahead, hit my shoulder blades
Those who don't have to lubricate
Sure got it made
Slide some oil to me
Let it slip down my side
Laying there in one position
Sure does make me tired

Now watch me dance!
And let me lubricate my mind

Well, you best not make me frown
For I just might knock you down

You know I'm ready to fight
And turn your day into night
'Cause I'm a mean ole lion

You'll detour to the right
From a mean ole lion

And if I happen to let you slide
Don't just stand here
Run and hide
You just caught my better side

Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back there
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection

And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

Suddenly my world has changed it's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing

If you're listening God
Please don't make it hard to know
For us to believe in the things that we see

Tell us should we run away
Or should we try and stay?
Or would it be better just to let things be?

Living here, in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So it's real, real to me

And I've learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find a world full of love

Conjuring ghosts to relive her lie
Wandering through the night

Mumbling something about a plan
He's onto his own demise

With a murder on his mind
On and on and on and on

It's our to watch unity suffering
I wacked my tears and asked myself
Is this something that I could have done
To show her that there's always love to find

Clouds in the sky
Break away from you and me
You should know well everyone inside dreams
I will be finding you

So just don't worry, we can chase the rain (the rain)
And fall (in love) in love
For good baby (so just don't worry baby)
So just don't worry mama
So just don't worry, you can take the pain (the pain)
It's all (allowed)
About thrill babe (so just don't worry baby)
So just don't worry mama

So just don't worry, we can chase the rain (the rain)
And fall (in love) in love
For good baby (so just don't worry mama)
You can take the pain (the pain)

"You never told me you were going away
Oh why? Oh why?
You'll never hear the words I meant to say
Oh why?

You never should have acted like you care
You could have turned around and walk the other way

I never wanna hear you say goodbye to me
I never wanna hear you say goodbye
I never wanna hear you say goodbye, goodbye

You pull the heart by out of me
Oh why? Oh why?
My eyes were blind and you made me see
Oh why?

A love life guards to fall apart
Why did I take so long to catch on from the start?

I never wanna to hear you say goodbye to me
I never wanna to hear you say goodbye
Never wanna say goodbye
I never want to hear you say goodbye, goodbye

"[Verse 1]
You can drown in your sorrows, you can float out to sea
Where the maelstrom is hollerin', for a moment you’re free
Oh, vagabond warrior, you’re a long way from home
Where the eagles are soaring, and kings are enthroned

[Chorus]
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
I've been struck by lightning

[Verse 2]
You’ve been spared from the gallows, but it’s still not the end
You got the rest of your life to make your amends
It’s harbor you’re seeking, and shelter from harm
Don’t leave me here stranded, better sound the alarm

[Chorus]
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
I've been struck by lightning

[Bridge]
The heavens opened up, and an angel spoke:
""You can’t go home, they’ll just keep throwing stones.""
""You’re better off on more enlightened shores.""
""You stick around and you’ll get nothing...""

Can you save me?

And I hear the sound of pouring rain
But you're not here
Where did you go
I wanna know what made you go away
What went wrong?

I'm looking out my window pane
And I hear the sound of pouring rain
There's no-one here to laugh with me
To make the dark clouds disappear
My love, what went wrong?

Where did you go - there is no answer
I need you now much more than ever
Where did you go - why can't you be with me
Where did you go - we were so tender
Where did you go - why not surrender
Only you can set me free

I'm looking out my window pane (Oh yes)
And I hear the sound of pouring rain
I think of you, of someone who can
Always count on love so true
And I'm here - where are you?

Tell me...

"10.000 Lightyears somewhere out in space
They practice love and they know what it takes
No competition and no jealousy
Living in freedom and humanity

10.000 Lightyears away, lightyears away far from pain
Came to a place full of grace and of peace
10.000 Lightyears away from our fear

Suddenly it's ringing in my ears
Why is it now I don't wanna be here
I feel like flow in that clock at the wall
God, how I wish that this dream would go on

10.000 Lightyears away, lightyears away far from pain
Came to a place full of grace and of peace
10.000 Lightyears away from our fear

10.000 Lightyears somewhere out in space (10.000 Lightyears)

Just to wake up beside you
Is something I've missed for so long
I'm so glad that you came back home

Baby let me tell you
How my days slipped away
And how I was afraid of the night
But now I'm alright

I feel good
Feeling like a lover should
What else can I say
Won't forget the day
You came back to stay
I feel so good (I feel good, I feel good, I feel good)
Finally we understood
You and me were meant
True lovers from the start
We can never part

Our love is grown stronger
More than any temptation
In this world could possibly be
There's no doubt 'cause it's plain to see

Feeling like a lover should
What else can I say
Won't forget the day
You came back to stay

Until their final curtains fall

Too much to choose
