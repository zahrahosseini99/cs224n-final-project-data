[Verse 1]
Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand, oh my little girl?
[Chorus]
All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here, in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Verse 2]
Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does their pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here, in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here, in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

All I ever wanted, all I ever needed
Is here, in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Outro]
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
Enjoy the silence
[Verse 1]
You wear guilt
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse
I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
And in your head it's worse

[Verse 2]
There's a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Can't you see
All love's luxuries
Are here for you and me

[Chorus]
And when our worlds, they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

[Verse 3]
Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms

[Chorus]
And when our worlds, they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it
[Verse 1]
Ah, because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round

[Verse 2]
Ah, because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high

{Chorus}
Ah, love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you

[Verse 3]
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue

[Outro]
Ahh-ah-ah-ahhhh

Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

Get back, get back
Get back to where you once belonged

[Verse 1]
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
[Pre-Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
[Verse 2]
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
[Pre-Chorus]
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
[Chorus]
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people

[Verse 3]
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved

[Pre-Chorus]
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people (Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?

I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you’ve been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long

[Chorus]
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I’m crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess

I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob

[Verse 5]
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

[Chorus]
I am the egg man (now good sir, what are you?)
They are the egg men (a poor man, made tame to fortune's blows)
I am the walrus, goo goo g’joob (good pity)
G-goo goo g’joob

[Verse 6]
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
(ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha)
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I’m crying

[Verse 7]
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them kicking Edgar Allan Poe

Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
[Verse 3]
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 2]
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Verse 3]
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

[Outro]
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo-Fanques Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
'ving been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill

Yeah-yeah-yeah...
Yeaahhh, yeah-yeah-yeah...
Coming down fast, but I'm miles above you...
Yeaahhh...
Tell me, tell me, tell me, c'mon, tell me the answer...
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
Yeaahhh...

You know I need someone
(Help!)
[Verse 1]
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
[Verse 2]
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before

[Chorus]
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground

Oooooooohhhhh
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday

Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mm mm mm mm mm mm mm

That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad

[Chorus: Take 1]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

{Verse 2: Take 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me

[Chorus: Take 26]
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever

[Verse 3: Take 26]
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people

Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it

To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

Enihsnus
Enihsnus ho
[Instrumental Intro}

[Verse 1]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 2]
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high

[Pre-Chorus]
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

[Verse 3]
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes

[Chorus]
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 1]
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

[Verse 2]
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade

{Drum Solo}
Great!
Oh!
Great!
Great that!
Beautiful!
Sensational!
Fab!
Isn't that great?
[Verse 3]
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do

[Chorus]
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
[Bridge 1]
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

[Verse 2]
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

[Instrumental: Ronnie Scott]

[Bridge 2]
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending

While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

Sugarplum fairy, sugarplum fairy

[Verse 1]
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Midtro + alarm clock rings]

[Bridge]
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

{Chord]
Ahhhhaaaaahhhhaaaahhhhhhahhhhhhhh

[Verse 2]
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on

[Instrumental Outro + Final Chord]
[Verse 1]
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

[Verse 2]
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better

[Bridge 1]
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na na na na na na na na

[Verse 3]
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
(Let it out and let it in)
Remember (Hey Jude) to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it
Better better better better better better, oh

[Outro]
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!)
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude
Naa na na na na na na, (Ow!)

(Jude!)
Naa na na na na na na, (Yeah yeah yeah!)
na na na na, hey Jude
(You know you can make, Jude Jude, You're not gonna break it)
Naa na (Don't make it bad Jude) na na na na na (Take a sad song and make it better), na na na na, hey Jude
Hey Jude, hey Jude wowwwwww
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude (Oh Jude!)
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude (Yeah, Hey!
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude (Hey hey!
Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude Jude
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude (Oooh)

Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude (Oooh)
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude (Woo!)

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Day after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Verse 2]
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

{Instrumental bridge}

[Verse 3]
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings

[Chorus]
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do, Do)
Round and round and round and round and round

[Verse 4]
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him

[Chorus]
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

[Outro]
Ooh (Round and round and round)
Ooh (Round and round and round)
[Verse 1]
Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day

[Chorus]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 2]
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

[Chorus]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Bridge]
She's the kind of girl who puts you down (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When friends are there, you feel a fool (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
(Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
When you say she's looking good (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She acts as if it's understood (tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh (Tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit, tit)

[Chorus]
Girl
Girl, girl

[Verse 3]
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
[Chorus]
Ah, girl
Girl, girl

[Outro]
Ah, girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl
[Verse 1]
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

[Hook]
I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh and I...
I wish that I could work it out

[Verse 2]
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

[Hook]
I can feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're a silver lining the clouds
Oh and I...
Oh and I...
I wonder what it's all about

I wonder what it's all about

[Verse 3]
Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart
Oh and that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
Yeah that's the hardest part
That's the hardest part
[Verse 1]
They put the world in a tin can
Black market contraband
And it hurt just a little bit
When they sliced and packaged it
In a long black trench coat
Two hands around the throat
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes

[Verse 2]
There's so much to be scared of
And not much to make sense of
How did the clowns ever get control?
Oh, if you hear can you let me know
How can they invade it
Oh, when it's so complicated?
Oh, you wanna get it right sometimes
You just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times can you say
You can't believe what you heard?
That's how you see the world
Don't you worry yourself
You're not gonna get hurt
Oooh

[Verse 3]
Is there's something missing
There's nobody listening
Are you're running in a circle
How can you be too careful?
We don't wanna be man-trapped
We don't wanna be shrink-wrapped
Oh, just wanna get it right sometimes
We just wanna get it right sometimes

[Chorus]
That's how you see the world
How many times have you heard
That you can't believe a word
That's how you see the world
Oh, don't you worry yourself
'Cause nobody can hurt you

[Outro]
That's how you see the world
That's how you see the world
[Verse 1: Rufus Wainwright]
The girl's perfection
Inspires affection
It's queer
That here
He can't cast his spell
In her direction
Somewhere near
One senses fear
Casanova in Hell

[Verse 2: Rufus Wainwright & Neil Tenant]
The girl is naked
The boy is naked
He hides
Inside
A secret chamber
There to gape
Through a velvet drape
And dream of rape
Casanova in Hell

[Verse 3: Rufus Wainwright]
Her sharp suggestion
He couldn't get an erection
Came as a shock
He finds himself
A laughing-stock
His ageing fate
To contemplate
Casanova in Hell

[Verse 4: Rufus Wainwright & Neil Tenant]
Back in the lib'ry
His revenge is his story
What he will write
Will recall the bite
Of his wit
And legendary appetite
The sybarite
Casanova is well

[Outro: Rufus Wainwright]
For Casanova has the last laugh
Creates the myth and vindication
Of his sexual vocation
Makes the definitive collection
His lives and lovers and above all
His erection
Will live in historY
[Verse 1]
How dare you say that my behavior's unacceptable?
So condescending, unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step, 'cause if I do, you'll need a miracle
You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay, but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Verse 2]
What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better, you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up" (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
She said, is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And does it kill?
Does it burn?
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?
Does it thrill?
Does it sting when you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?
[Chorus]
But when it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up"
And like a little girl cries in the face
Of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
Is there anyone out there?
'Cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe
[Verse 1]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Verse 2]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But, oh

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh ohh, oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh, ohh

[Bridge]
I'll fix these broken things, repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright (It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips, sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you 'cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
[Verse 1]
You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of run-around
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied till I'm under your skin

[Verse 2]
Immobilized by the thought of you
I'm paralyzed by the sight of you
I'm hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied till I'm under your skin

[Guitar Solo]
Yeah, oh
(You feel your heart begin to race!)
[Chorus]
There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied till I'm under your skin
Yeah, yeah, there may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied till I'm under your skin
[Verse 1]
Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Verse 2]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Bridge]
I know where you hide
Alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her
Every time she falls, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Tap on my window, knock on my door, I
Want to make you feel beautiful

[Chorus]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain, oh
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

[Post-Chorus]
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

[Outro fading out]
I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
[Verse 1]
I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be okay to show
My face around here
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

[Pre-Chorus]
Would you ever turn your head and look?
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know, I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh

[Verse 2]
You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get

[Pre-Chorus]
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know, I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You better turn your head and run
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

[Chorus]
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know, I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Yeah, tangled
(And I've done you so wrong)
(Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself)
(I don't know how I got so tangled up)
[Verse 1]
After school, walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass
And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate
Images life gives us from our past
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun"

[Verse 2]
Now, moving on, down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
I think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps
And sometimes it's a sad song

[Chorus]
But I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun"

[Bridge]
The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me
Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

[Chorus]
I cannot forget, refuse to regret
So glad I met you and
Take my breath away, make everyday
Worth all of the pain that I have gone through
And mama, I've been crying
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles"
She said, "The battle's almost won
And we're only several miles from the Sun"

[Outro]
Yeah, oh, oh, yeah
(Several miles from the Sun, yeah)
(Woo!)
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

[Pre-Chorus]
Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Verse 2]
This is not goodbye, she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

[Pre-Chorus]
When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you cry

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Bridge]
There's only so much I can do for you
After all of the things you put me through, oh

[Chorus]
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

[Outro]
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

[Refrain]
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace your every outline
Paint a picture with my hands
Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

[Chorus]
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

[Refrain]
Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

[Chorus]
And you may not know
That may be all I need
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah
Ah yeah, yeah

[Outro]
It's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes
Off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Car overheats
Jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long
Your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh no

[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

[Verse 3]
I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around
There you are

[Verse 4]
Cool these engines
Calm these jets
I ask you how hot can it get
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly you say "I'm not there yet!"
[Chorus]
I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
But can they keep it
Oh no, they can't
[Verse 1]
Can you see me
Floating above your head
As you lay in bed
Thinking about everything
That you did not do?
'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it

[Verse 2]
And I don't trust you
'Cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear
I spend every hour waiting for a phone call
That I know will never come
I used to think you were the one
Now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Verse 3]
Do you remember the way we used to melt?
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you?
Oh, 'cause I remember very well

[Bridge]
And how long has it been
Since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you?
And at night when you sleep
Do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?
[Chorus]
You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

[Chorus]
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you
You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache heartache I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you

[Outro]
I ain't ever coming back to you
[Verse 1]
When you refuse me
You confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

[Verse 2]
You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't want to say
But have to say them anyway
I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

[Chorus]
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
And does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
I'll bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

[Outro]
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home
[Verse 1]
Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?
[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I...

[Verse 2]
Dream away everyday
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

[Chorus]
Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have some things to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

[Outro]
How does it feel to know you never have to be alone
When you get home?
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
[Verse 1]
How ya feelin'?
The day has had its way with both of us
And oh, I've gone out of my way
But I'm not free
From this pain I'm reelin'
I was a fool to think someday
You would come around
But no, no, no
I'm not thinking that way

[Interlude]
'Cause now I see
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just want to scream

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
You're not coming in

[Verse 2]
How's your day been?
(yeah)
'Cause mine has taken strange and ugly turns
But no, no, no
I feel better today
Because I'm off my knees

[Interlude]
You are not what you seem
You are a mystery to me
Sometimes I just want to scream

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
You're not coming in
A hot minute for a life of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows
Lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore  (yeah)

[Chorus]
I think you should just go away 'cause
There's no necessity for you to stay and
Next time you come around my way
Forget it baby
You're not coming in
A hot minute for a life of sorrow
No you can't come back tomorrow
Shut my windows
Lock my doors
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore (oh, oh, yeah, yeah)
'Cause my heart won't be your ragdoll anymore
[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woahh
Ohh, woah, woahh

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Oh, kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again, but

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Interlude: Adam Levine & John Legend]
Ohh, woah, woah

[Bridge: Adam Levine]
I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
Oh, my pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

[Hook: Adam Levine (W/ John Legend Vocals)]
Oh, this love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
I have no choice
'Cause I won't say goodbye anymore

[Outro: Adam Levine]
This love has taken its toll on me
She said goodbye too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said goodbye too many times before
Oh yeah, yeah...
And she will be loved...
[Verse 1]
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

[Pre-Chorus 1]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" (Oh-oh)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no-no, hee-hee-hee)
Hoo!
[Verse 2]
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice!
(A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
(Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"
(Don't break no hearts!)
(Hee-hee)
But she came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume (Ha-oh)
This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo!)
Hey-ay

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my lover (Hoo!)
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no (Hoo!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (Oh, no, no)
She says I am the one (Oh baby)
But the kid is not my son (No, hee-hee!)
[Break]
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee!
Hoo!
[Chorus]
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo!
(Ouw!)
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(You know what you did to me, baby)
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no (No-no-no, no-no-no)
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son (No-no-no-no)

[Outro]
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breakin' my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Don't call me Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover (She is just a girl)
(Hoo!
She's not at the scene)
Billie Jean is not (Hee!
Aaow!
Ooh!)
Billie Jean is
[Verse 1]
They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You better run, you better do what you can (Ooh!)
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (Ooh!)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it)
Just beat it (Beat it, uh)

[Verse 2]
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (Ooh!)
You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh!)
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh!)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad

[Chorus]
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it (Beat it, beat it, beat it)

Beat it (Beat it, beat it)
Beat it (Beat it, beat it)
Beat it (Beat it, beat it)

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right (Who's right)
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it (Hoo-hoo!)
No one wants to be defeated (Oh, lord)
Showin' how funky (Hee-hee!)
and strong is your fight (Hee-hee-hee!)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated (Oh-no!)
Showin' how funky (Hoo-hoo!)
and strong is your fight (Hee-hee!
Hoo!)
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated

Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it (Hoo-hoo!)
No one wants to be defeated
[Skit]
Hey!
What?
Turn that off!
Dad, this is the best part!
Turn it off!

It’s too late for this, turn it off!
Dad, this is the best part, come on!
No, turn it off now!
No, this is the, I want to listen to it, okay?
You’ve got things to do tomorrow
Yeah, right.
Too late.

Eat this

[Intro]
Aaow!
Aaow!
[Verse 1]
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
Hee!
[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh!
[Verse 2]
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
Hoo!
[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Hoo!
Gone withca girl!
Hee-hee!
[Bridge]
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

[Rap: L.T.B.]
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
Hee-hee!
[Chorus]
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

[Outro]
Alright, alright
Ah, dah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Dah, ah, dah, alright
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright, alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Shamone, don't
Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo!
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by (Ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's black, it's white, hoo!
(Shamone, dah)
[Intro: Child]
Think about the generations and say that we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they, they, they know it's a better world for them, and think, if they can make it a better place...

[Verse 1]
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Verse 2]
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
To make a better world

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Bridge]
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Would this Earth crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow

[Verse 3]
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares

[Pre-Chorus 3]
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

[Chorus]
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Post-Chorus]
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

[Outro: Michael Jackson & Child]
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
Make a better place (You and for me)
(You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children (You and for me)
Heal the world we live in (You and for me)
Save it for our children
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Post-Chorus]
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

[Verse 2]
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

[Bridge]
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

[Chorus]
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
That you are not alone (You are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away, you and me)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (You are always in my heart)
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone (Not alone, oh)

[Outro]
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh!
Together, together
Not not being alone!
Not not being alone!
You believe in me!
[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
(Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time

[Chorus 2: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight

[Bridge: Michael Jackson]
Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh

[Verse 3: Michael Jackson]
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
(Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

[Chorus 3: Michael Jackson]
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
(Ooh, ooh)
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

[Outro: Vincent Price & Michael Jackson]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller, ooh, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
(Thriller night, thriller)
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years (Thriller night, thriller)
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
[Spoken Intro]
The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 1]
I never knew but I was walkin' the line (Hee!)
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" (Hee-hee!)
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" (Hee!)
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone (Hee!
Hee!)
[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Spoken Interlude]
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous

[Verse 2]
I never knew but I was livin' in vain (Hee!)
She called my house, she said "You know my name"
(You know my name!)
"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
(Don't you, don't you, baby!)
(Hee!)
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
(Don't you, don't you, don't) (Hee!
Hee!
Hee!
Hee!)
[Chorus]
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

[Alternate Chorus]
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
(Dog gone!)
I have to pray to God, 'cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul, but you're no damn lover friend of mine

[Ad-Libs]
Hee-hee!
Oooh!
Oooh!
Hoo!
[Bridge]
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation, you hurt my baby

[Spoken Interlude]
And then it happened, she touched me
For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil, but her inner spirit and words were as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it, 'cause it's dangerous

[Chorus]
Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
(Hee!)
Take away my money, throw away my time (Oh!)
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me

Dangerous (Hee!)
The girl is so dangerous (Hee-hee!)
(Hee!)

[Verse 1]
There is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Verse 2]
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call

[Chorus]
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

[Bridge]
Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that

[Chorus]
We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Come on, yeah
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Oh yeah, we got it
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

(Repeat & Fade Out)
[Verse 1]
Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 2]
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

[Verse 3: Heavy D]
Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the door, 3 and 4's in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
Cause it aren’t too hard to

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

[Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

[Verse 2]
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

[Extended Chorus]
I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Who?)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Who?)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

I'm starting with the man in the mirror (Man in the mirror, oh yeah)
I'm asking him to change his ways (Change his ways)
(Come on, change)
And no message could have been any clearer

[Bridge]
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (You can't)
Then you close your mind (Close your, your mind!)
[Chorus]
(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man)
(Ooh!)
(That man, that man) I'm asking him to change his ways
(That man, the man)
(Change his ways, ooh!)
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
(Take a look at yourself and then make that)
Change!
[Outro]
Woo, woo (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana) woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good (Oh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana)
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone (Change)
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself, (Yeah) hoo!
(Make that change) I gotta make that change today, woo!
(Man in the mirror) You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo!
(Yeah)
You know (Make that change)
I've gotta get that man, that man (Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up (Yeah) stand up (Make that change) stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (Man in the mirror)
Hoo, hoo, hoo!
Ow!
(Yeah, make that change)
Make that change, Shamone (Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (Change)
Make that change
[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine m-m-m

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

[Hook: Paul McCartney]
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Verse 3: Michael + Paul]
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
Well I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To one's town

[Bridge: Micheal Jackson]
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever

[Verse 4: Michael + Paul]
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine

[Refrain: Michael + Paul]
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yep, she's mine (mine, mine)
The girl is mine (mine, mine); yeah, she's mine (mine, mine)

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine

[Interlude: Michael + Paul]
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

[Outro: Michael + (Paul)]
(I don't believe it!)
(Mine, mine)
(No, no, no) The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, mine) No, mine (Mine, mine)
(She's mine, mine, mine, mine, mine) (Mine, mine, mine)
'Cause the girl is mine
(No, the girl is mine) (Mine, mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine, mine)
(No, the girl is mine)
The girl is mine (Mine, mine)
(No, she's mine)
[Intro]
I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

[Verse 1]
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
[Verse 2]
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
[Bridge]
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby

[Chorus]
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

[Breakdown]
(Remember the time)
Hoo!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
(Remember the time)
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
(Remember the time)
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat
Grrrrrat, tat tat
(Remember the time)
Hoo!
In the park
(Remember the time)
After dark, do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you, did you?

[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

You were struck down
It was your doom

A Smooth Criminal

Aaow!
[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation

[Pre-Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?

Will you tell us that you're okay?

You were struck down

Hey, pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me

Oh, I'll be workin' from 9 to 5
To buy you things to keep you by my side

I've never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied

Choo-coo, choo-coo, choo-coo
G'on, girl!
[Outro]
The way you make me feel (Hee-hee!)
(Hee-hee-hee!)
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone

Give it to me
Give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
G'on, girl!
(My lonely days are gone)

Give it to me
Give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on, be my girl
I wanna be with mine
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
[Verse 1]
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty

[Verse 2]
Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history

[Pre-Chorus]
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world

[Bridge]
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh

[Chorus]
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony

[Outro]
A soldier dies
A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
[Verse 1]
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?
[Verse 2]
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human

[Bridge]
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me

[Verse 4: Michael Jackson & Cleveland Orchestra]
Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me and free me
Yeah
I will feel blessed
I'm only human
Carry
Carry
Carry me boldly
Carry me
Lift me up slowly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
Softly you say to me
I will be there
I will be there
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Yeah
Show me you care
Hold me
Hoo!
Lay your head lowly
It gets lonely sometimes
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Hoo!
Love me and feed me
Lift me up, hold me up
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed

[Spoken]
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heart
[Intro]
I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much

[Verse 1: Michael & Siedah]
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Both & Siedah]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you

[Verse 2: Michael & Siedah & Both]
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you

[Chorus: Michael & Both]
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

[Bridge: Michael & Siedah & Both]
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always

[Chorus: Both]
I just can't stop loving you (No, baby)
I just can't stop loving you (If I can't stop)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do (What will I do?)
I just can't stop loving you (Hee-hee-hee, without you, girl)
I just can't stop loving you (You know I do)
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
[Verse 1]
Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine

[Pre-Chorus]
You gotta feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away (Rock, right)

[Verse 2]
Out on the floor
There ain't nobody there but us
Girl, when you dance
There's a magic that must be love
Just take it slow
'Cause we got so far to go

[Pre-Chorus]
When you feel that heat
And we're gonna ride the boogie
Share that beat of love

[Chorus]
I wanna rock with you (All night)
Dance you into day (Sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (All night)
We're gonna rock the night away

[Bridge]
And when the groove is dead and gone (Yeah)
You know that love survives
So we can rock forever, on
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you
I wanna rock with you
I wanna groove with you

[Chorus]
I wanna rock (All night)
With you girl (Sunlight)
Rock with you, rock with you girl (Yeah)

Tired of the schemes

So what does it mean, damn it?
Kicking me down

As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damn it

[Verse 2: Janet Jackson]
Peek in the shadow
Come into the light

Then you better prove you're right!
You're selling out souls but I
I care about mine
I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream?

While you're playing the game

I think I might go insane

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson and Janet Jackson]
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream?
(Make you want to scream?)

Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me want to scream

[News Man]

After being wrongly
Identified as a robbery suspect!
The man was an 18 year-old black male!)

[Verse 1]
Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?
), why (why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?
), why (why?
), does he do me that way?
If they say why (why?

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?

Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?
), why (why?

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?

[Bridge]
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why?
Oh, why?

Oh, why?
[Verse 3]
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

[Chorus]
If they say why (why?

Tell them that it's human nature
Why (why?

[Verse 1]
What about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things that you said we were to gain?
What about killing fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine?
[Pre-Chorus 1]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?
[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Verse 2]
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine?
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores?
[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Bridge]
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far

[Chorus]
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh

[Breakdown]
Hey, what about yesterday?
(What about us?)
What about the seas?

The heavens are falling down (What about us?)
I can't even breathe (What about us?)
What about Africans (What about us?)
I ain't even through (What about us?)
What about nature's worth?
(Ooh)
It's our planet's womb (What about us?)
What about animals?
(What about it?)
Turned kingdom to dust (What about us?)
What about elephants?
(What about us?)
Have we lost their trust?
(What about us?)
What about crying whales (What about us?)
Ravaging the seas?
(What about us?)
What about forest trails?
(Ooh)
Burnt, despite our pleas (What about us?)
What about the holy land?
(What about it?)
Torn apart by creed?
(What about us?)
What about the common man?
(What about us?)
Can't we set them free?
(What about us?)
What about children dying?
(What about us?)
Can't you hear them cry?
(What about us?)
Where did we go wrong?
(Ooh)
Someone tell me why (What about us?)
What about baby boy?
(What about it?)
What about the days?
(What about us?)
What about all their joy?

Ah, ooh
[Verse 1]
You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart

[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no

[Verse 2]
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Interlude]
Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana, -iana, -iana
C'mon!
[Verse 3]
She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."
[Chorus]
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana

[Outro]

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothin' he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin' (Hee)

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!
[Verse 3]
Billie Jean is always talkin' when nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Sayin' you just want to be startin' somethin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
Still they hate you (Still they hate you)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
You're just a buffet (You're just a buffet) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable (You're a vegetable)
They eat off of you (They eat off of you) (You're a vegetable)
You're a vegetable, aaow!
[Instrumental Interlude]
Aaow!
Hee-haw!
(Ooh!)
[Verse 4]
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
Then don't have a baby (Yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (Yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'

[Chorus]
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
You're too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)

[Bridge]
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl (Hee-ha)
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

[Intro: Chris Tucker & Michael Jackson]
Oh man!
Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious!
That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine!
She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right!
Shomon, then, Shomon!
Watch
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild, I like that

[Verse 1]
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels so right (Girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life (All my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ooh, it feels like I (Like I)
Have finally found her perfect love is mine (See)
And I finally found, come on, girl

[Chorus]
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Girl)
And everything I own I give (Come on, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 2]
In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I (Oh)
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life (Searched for all my life)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think I'd find
(Whoa oh oh)
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right (Whoa, girl)

[Chorus]
You rocked my world, you know you did (Come on, come on, come on, come on)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Girl)
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (Girl)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Oh)
And everything I own I give (You rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world (Oh), you know you did
And everything I own I give (To rock my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine

[Verse 3]
And girl, I know that this is love
I feel the magic all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here, hoo

[Chorus]
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know you did
And everything I own I give (Look what you did to me, baby, yeah)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (You rocked my world)
You rocked my world, you know you did (Know you did baby)
And everything I own I give (Cause you rocked my world)
The rarest love who'd think I'd find (Hoo, hoo)
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me, the way you're lovin' me
The way you give it to me
You rocked my world, you know you did
(Give it to me)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah ooh)
You rocked my world (You rocked my world), you know
You did
(You rocked my world, you rocked my world)
(Come on, girl) You rocked my world (Come on, girl)
You know you did
(Baby, baby, baby)
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
[Chorus]
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life

[Verse 1]
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
It's out of my hands

[Bridge]
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late

[Chorus]
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
[Verse 1]
Once, all alone
I was lost, in a world of strangers
No, one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You, suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before, but now it's all clear
You, took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are my life

[Verse 2]
Now, I wake up, every day
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
‘Cause you love me
You, help me understand
That love is the answer, to all that I am
And I'm, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world

[Bridge]
You gave me strength
When I wasn’t as strong
You gave me hope, when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes, when I couldn't see
Love was always here waiting, for me

[Chorus]
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are my life
[Verse 1]
When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Verse 2]
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall (Live it off the wall)

[Bridge]
Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you (Ain't no rules, it's all up to you)
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night (All right)

[Verse 3]
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition (A-hee!)
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way

[Chorus]
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all (Live life off the wall)
Live your life off the wall
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Yeah)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Wanna live)
Tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf (Nine to five)
And just enjoy yourself (Come on, and)
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all (Yeah)
[Verse 1]
If you called out loud
Would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis?
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
Give yourself a chance

Because you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a, little self-esteem

[Chorus]
So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You gotta know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off’n the ground

Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner
But you got ta keep the faith
Go'n keep it brother
You got it

[Verse 2]
And when ya think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone?
And you can go by the feel
‘stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance

I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take
Will get you there
If you’ll only try

[Chorus]
So keep the faith
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground

Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
I told my brother how to do da thing right
Lift up your head and show the world ya got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be better
But you got to keep the faith
Go’n keep it brother
You got it

[Bridge]
I know that keepin' the faith
Means never givin' up on love
But the power that love has to make it right
Makes it uh, makes it right

[Chorus]
So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off the ground

Keep the faith baby, yeah
Because it is just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

[Verse 3]
Better stand up and act like you wanna do right
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday
Go for what you want
And don't forget the faith
Look at yourself
And what ya doin' right now
Stand back a minute
Just to check yourself out
Straighten out your life
And how you're livin' each day
Get yourself together
‘cause you got to keep the faith

Go'n
Don't let nobody take you down, brother
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out

Lift up your mind
Before your mind gets blown
Some things in life
You best just leave them alone
Go for what you want
Don't let it get in your way
You can make it happen
But ya got ta keep the faith

[Bridge]
Go'n keep it brother
You got to keep the faith
Yeah keep the faith
Go'n keep it sister
You got to keep the faith
Now, now

[Verse 4]
I showed my brotha
How to do the thing right
Lift up your head
And show the world you got pride
Go for what you want
Don't let 'em get in your way
You can be a winner
If you keep'a the faith

Straighten out yourself
And get your mind on track
Dust off your butt
And get your self-respect back
You've known me too long
To know that I don't play
Take it like you wanna
But you got to keep the faith


[Chorus]
Go'n
Don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And get your feet back on the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yea
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
But till that day
I say you've got to keep the faith!
[Chorus]
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

[Verse 1]
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just

[Chorus]
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile

[Verse 2]
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
[Verse 1]
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can’t take this stuff no more

[Verse 2]
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

[Pre-Chorus]
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

[Bridge]
Hee-hee, hee-hee!
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, I never would
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me

(Who is it?)
It is a friend of mine?
(Who is it?)
To me, I'm bothered!
(Who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(Who is it?)
I can't take it cause I'm lonely

[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Body)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
[Chorus]
And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
(Da da da da)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(You can really say I'm lonely)

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
(Don't be, don't be, don't be judging)
'Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
(Don't be, don't do)
Did she find in someone else?
(Can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)

And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me)
And it doesn't seem right
(This won't cut it)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(Think of another brother)
Don't you judge of my composure
(Don't be judging)
'Cause I'm bothered every day
(Don't be, don't be)
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
(Can't you really feel I'm lonely?)
And it doesn't seem to matter (Hee-hee!)
And it doesn't seem right (Hee-hee!)
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
(She don't, she don't want me)
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
(She don't, she don't, she don't need it)
And she didn't leave a letter
(She don't, she don't want it)
She just upped and ran away
(Is it my brother?)
And it doesn't seem to matter
(Don't bother me, you just couldn't)
And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
(Da da, da da, da da, da)
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure (Hee!)
'Cause I'm lying to myself (Hee!)
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(I can't take it 'cause I'm lonely)
[Verse 1]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me

[Chorus]
People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood
I've never known

[Verse 2]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask
Have you seen my Childhood?
[Chorus]
People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known

[Verse 3]
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had

[Outro]
Have you seen my Childhood

[Intro]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and its head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off
But Momma don't want me, the next thing I know, I'm gettin' dropped off
Gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off
Ring-ring-ring on the doorbell of the next door neighbors, on their front porch
Their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch
But they didn't want me neither, so they left me on someone else's lawn
Else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn
'Til somebody finally took me in, my great aunt and uncle, Edna and Charles
Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, Edna and Charles, they were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary, they'd gang up on me and sing this song
Sing this song, sing this song, sing this song, sing this song
It went a little something like
"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn"
Momma why do they keep sayin' this?
I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my dad?
[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly-white, predominantly black.
Well, what about me?
Where does that leave me?
Well, I guess that I'm between predominantly both of 'em
I think if I hear that fuckin' word again, I'ma scream
While I'm projectile vomitin'; what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kiddin'?
What do I look like, some kinda idi...
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that; why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit?
It's such bullshit, it's tush mull bish
"Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin' about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin' in
And the dad that he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife, how they go at it
Man, I'd hate to have it as bad as that Mr. Mathers claims he had it
I can't imagine it.
That little rich, poor, white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out of the bank and take a bath in it
Man, if I only had half of it"
Shit, if you only knew the half of it...
Haha

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds

[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, Mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn
Never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why are you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale.
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me there's people everywhere
I don't even know but who feel like they know me 'cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, do-si-do now, curtains up, the show must go now
Ring-around-the-rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame was supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off-and-on?
This ain't what I chose to be
So please, God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'Til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone

[Hook]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
I said, Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
(Evil deeds, evil deeds, evil deeds)

[Outro]
[Gunshot]
[Crowd cheering]
Oh!
Last one, baby, let's go
Last one, baby, let's go
Detroit!
[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Dre-zie
Will have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erased me
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
Like I'm goin' too fast 'cause my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies
And gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die-hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving
To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
'Cause I've been patiently waiting for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You gon' say the wrong shit and get your whole face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, your peace talk, save it
Your shit sounds dated, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you motherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy – you payin' attention, boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug, press play, you ain't gotta sniff it
Shoot it or pop it, roll it, bag it or chop it
It'll get you high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh, it's never enough
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many emcees I eat up
Oh oh, it's never enough
[Intro: Morris Casuto, Spiro Agnew, Randy Blazak & Eminem]
What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls (Yeah) their throwaway children
We seem to be approaching (C'mon!)
an age of the gross (*Burp*)
We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each—and each generation should do a little bit better

[Verse 1: Eminem]
All right, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss
Statements that's made on this tape and its whole origin of
The music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the East Side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stoppin' in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Bridge: Eminem]
I'd roam the streets so much they called me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke or steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps at Osborn, handin' out some flyers
We was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I told him to stop by and check us out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme."
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
Where compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next?
X Clan debuted
Professor X (Vanglorious!)
"Exist in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!"
Now with this bein' the new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus Albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butter would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin' 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was bein' laughed at
"You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!"
All I remember is meetin' back at
Manix's basement, sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryin' to two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school, who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even gonna say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts
And a pair of jugs, the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the "Ole Foolish Pride" girl, but I've heard
People say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a—

[Chorus: Eminem]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Outro: Debbie Mathers]
Fuck out of my house, you fuckin' pieces of shit!
Get the fuck out of my house, you stupid fucker!
You son of a bitch!
[Intro]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down...

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it
My crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means goin' toe-to-toe with a Benzino
It don't matter, I never drag 'em in battles that I can't handle
'Less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some JAY-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it that I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, that's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
That wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' ****
And that was just outta respect, for not runnin' my mouth
And talkin' about somethin' that I knew nothin' about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV, down-talkin' the man
Who literally saved my life, like fuck it, I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
But still knowin' the shit could pop off at any minute, 'cause—

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers

[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'
But now it's elevated, 'cause once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated—it ain't just words no more, is it?
It's a different ballgame, you call names and you ain't just rappin'
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50, smash him!
Mash on him, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up
'Cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'?
Well, fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then!
But I'm so busy bein' pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
But we still have soldiers that's on the front line
Who's willin' to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let 'em know how important
It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'
I'm just willin' to be the bigger man, if y'all can quit poppin'
Off at the jaws, well, then I can, 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience
'Cause—

[Chorus]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left, right, left, we all fall down
Like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on
For toy soldiers
[Intro]
I pledge allegiance to the flag
Of the United States of America
And to the republic for which it stands (People)
One nation, under God, indivisible
With liberty and justice for all (It feels so good to be back)
(Mosh with me now)

[Verse 1]
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight through the mind
I exercise my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight, you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
And if you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin'
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career, typical manure, movin' past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubber Band Man, yeah, he just snaps back

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together, let's all form and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people, some white and some black
Don't matter what color, all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah, the wetter, the better
They ain't gon' stop us, they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no, we say yeah, They tell us stop, we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push, shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home, come on, just

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin', just rainin' down on us
Moshpits outside the Oval Office
Someone's tryna tell us somethin', maybe this is God just
Sayin' we're responsible for this monster, this coward
That we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin'
How could we allow somethin' like this without pumpin' our fists?
Now this is our final hour
Let me be the voice and your strength and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times it, and multiply it by six
'Teen million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the president answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
We got our own battles to fight on our own soil
No more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinkin' that we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country, we're patronizin' a hero
Look in his eyes, it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out, and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why
'Cause I told you to fight

[Chorus]
So come along, follow me as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To proceed, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith and your trust as I guide us through the fog
To the light at the end of the tunnel, we gon' fight, we gon' charge
We gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors, come on

[Outro: Eminem & Hailie Jade]
And as we proceed
To mosh through this desert storm
And these closing statements
If they should argue, let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
And assemble our own army
To disarm this weapon of mass destruction
That we call our president for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak and be heard
Mr. President, Mr.
Senator
Can you guys hear us?
[Intro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
There I go, thinking of you again

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song, whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'ma start right here, I'll just be brief, I'm
'Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo
Of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim (Shi-i-i-i-i-i-it)
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you've ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you (Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-hoo)

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter that you'd probably just shred up, yeah
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece of
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking cokehead slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die (Di-i-i-i-i-i-ie)
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not 'cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yack (A-a-a-a-a-a-ack)
But what else can I do?
I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now all I wanna do is pu-u-u-u-u-u-uke

[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you I puke
You must just not kno-o-o-o-o-o-ow
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke

[Outro]
*Eminem pukes into the toilet*
*Eminem hocks and spits into the toilet*
*Toilet flush*
*Eminem burps*
Ah, damn!
Fucking bitch
[Intro]
Oh!
Yeah!
So much for first single on this one

[Verse 1]
Shady's the label, Aftermath is the stable
That the horses come out of—erra
Of course we're about to stir up
Some shit thick as Mrs. Buttersworth's syrup
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves-just-for-no-reason
Other than to—just to tease him
'Cause he was his biggest (*burp*) fan
He used to be Superman, now I'm pourin'
Liquor on the curb in his name for him
"Eminem, you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever said."
It goes one for the money, two for the fuckin' show
Ready, get set, let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo
Soldiers, I told ya I'm 'bout to blow, so look out below, Geronimo
Motherfuckers, it's dominoes, I'm on a roll
Around and around I go
When will I stop?
I don't know
Tryin' to pick up where The Eminem Show left off
But I know anything's possible
Though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away
With murder: I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes
In a safe, locked 'em away (*slam*)
Better watch what you say
Just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape
You swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua
Gosh, I wish I could've told you to not do the same
'Cause one day it could cost you your name

[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 2]
Eri-Eri-Erick swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derrick, bare-naked
Jig-a-jig-ji-ji-Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P.
to see R. Kelly
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee to be so young and naïve
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled, they cherish
Every picture with their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory-dickory Dirk Diggler, look at me work wizardry
With these words – am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or chiga-chigga-chig-chig-jer-chig-jer jerkin' your chain
Twenty-two jerks in a jerk circle, or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb} – wait, let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin' your chain?
Am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin' the dang
Cameras, filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade
Pornos, who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle
Jigga-ji-just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin videotapes of 'em fuckin'
When they was just Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
And dusted 'em and went straight to The Source with 'em
'Cause they could've sworn someone said, "Ni—"
And then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
"Ga-hu" and then they come to
Find out it was Justin sayin', "I'm gon—nuh cum!"
[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be.
my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka

[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'M-A-DICK-SUCKER-I'D-LOVE-TO-SUCK-A-DICK
And if someone picks up
You can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay and make up with Ray (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken like it's a big cock, big-a-big-cock!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick in your mouth
I'm done, you can fuck off, fuck-a-fuck-off!
[Chorus]
And this was supposed to be my first single (*burp*)
But I just fucked that up, so
Fuck it, let's all have fun, let's mingle (*burp*)
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle (*fart*)
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle (*fart*)
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, oh-oh-ah-ah
Oh, ah, erra, oh, ah, erra
Oh, ah, erra, poo-poo-ka-ka (*burp*)
[Skit: Paul Rosenberg]
Hey Em, it's Paul, uh, listen, I just got a call from the label
And you're probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the Just Lose It video
And, um, I mean he's pissed, so I-I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how we're gonna handle this
Um, oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um
They heard a rumor that you got a new gun
Um, I know it's probably not true
But I just need to talk to you about that
So, um, gimme a call
[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah
Definitely, definitely
Definitely dope
Definitely
Definitely K-Mart
Yeah
Yeah (*Pbfft*)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for finding me offensive
Hence, if I should draw the line or any fences
If so, to what extents, if any, should I go?
'Cause it's getting expensive
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths this far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too goddamn sensitive
It's censorship, and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now, 'cause I won't stand for this
And Chris-stiff-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too, I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me, I even believe I
Had one of those 25-cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must've put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault, 'cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman, I killed Super—
Man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is...
Rain Man

[Verse 2: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Now in the bible, it says:
"Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed
Have homosexual sex
Unless, of course, you were given the consent to join in
Then, of course, it's intercourse, and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad
'Long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before, during, or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly-known phrases
That are more used by today's kids in a more derogatory way
But who's to say what's fair to say and what not to say?"
Let's ask Dr. Dre—Dr.
Dre?
(What up?)
I got a question, if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend?
(Yeah)
And watch his butt-butt when he tees off?
(Yeah)
But— 'ut, I ain't done yet
In football, the quarterback yells out, "Hut-hut"
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts, but, just, what if
It was never meant—it was just an accident
But he tripped, fell, slipped, and his penis went in—
His teeny-tiny, little, round heinie, and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details, but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt?
Is that gay?
I just need to clear things up
'Til then, I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Verse 3: Eminem (Dr. Dre)]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive—shit, this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses?
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is telling me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next and open up a whoop-ass canister
God damn it, Dre, where's the goddamn beat?
(Yeah)
Anyway, anyway, I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good-at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic—yup, yup, don't worry, I'm on it
I got it, high-five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away (*Pfffffff*)
And as she flew around the room like a balloon, I
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna
Out the trash can, and, zoom, I
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter-jelly-chicken-tuna sandwich
And I ain't even gotta make no goddamn sense
I just did a whole song, and I didn't say shit

[Chorus: Eminem]
'Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi, my name is...
I forgot my name
My aim was not to become what I became
With this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil
My new name is Rain Man

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
'Cause ah, uh, ah, eh, ugh...
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super-dope beatmaker
2000 and
2000 and
400 and 87 million
900 and se-73,400 and 63...
And 70
Yeah
[Intro]
I don't understand
Why are you being so mean?
You're a mean, mean man

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 1]
Alright, listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open your mind, your eyes, close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make yoo-hoo?
Pippity-kaka-poo-poo
Psych, I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir, I have a question, why do I always sense this undeniable tension?
From the moment that I enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 2]
Alright now I (Shit), I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was, I fucked up
Psych, I'm kidding again, you idiot, no, I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay?
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something?
What, you munch a bunch of Crunch 'n Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
"Yes, I do, sir, what am I on?"
You, sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall, I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities"

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Verse 3]
Alright, now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
'Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, wanna check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How 'bout now?
What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying
Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying, there's no denying
That my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why are you even doing this to yourself?
It's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this?
This is torturous
My point is this
That if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just as...

[Chorus]
You're just jealous of me 'cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
'Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only 'cause you're just really jealous of me
'Cause I'm what you wanna be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, 'cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie

[Outro]
Fuck off my dick
[Spoken: Eminem]
Ayo Paul, it's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wow, well, I'll show him who's really bad {*burps*}
Paul, the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror
And tell him to beat it, because I won't stop 'til I get enough
Do you remember the time
We were watching the "Billie Jean" video?
Well, he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's black or white
Because I can't stop loving him
And I hate plastic surgeons, and I hope they all fucking die
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna' touch him, but I can't {*mouth noises*}
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit, sorry
Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no, I don't have a new gun
{*Gun cracks and bullets fall out*} God damn it!
[Intro]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, okay
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright, stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here, little kiddies, on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap?
And I don't mean "rap" as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I done touched on everything but little boys
And that's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good God, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
Up the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little poot-poot, it's okay
Oops, my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way 'til Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday, I don't know what day
Every day's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kinda breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin', all I know is
When I get there someone's gonna touch my body

[Verse 2]
'Scuse me, miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Could you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair?
Spit on me?
Maybe gouge my eyes out?
(Yeah)
Now, what's your name, girl?
What's your sign?
Man, you must be up out your mind
Dre (Ah-ah), beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind, now I'm

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Post-Chorus]
Well, it's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt-naked
Down the street screamin' (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Your honor, I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said, "Save it, boy, we got you on tape"
Yellin' at an old lady to touch my body

[Verse 3]
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's 8 Mile now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality look, it's B.
Rabbit
Yo, you signed me up to battle?
I'm a grown man
Chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubba-chubby
I don't have any lines to go right here, so chubba-Teletubby
Fellas (What?)
Fellas (What?)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (What?)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or
Butt squeezin', it's the season
Just go (Ah-ah-ah-ah), so appeasin'

[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance, yeah, boy, shake that ass
Whoops, I mean girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, you know you're my world
Alright, now lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Just lose it (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Go crazy (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Oh, baby (Ah-ah), oh, baby, baby (Ah-ah)

[Outro]
Touch my body
Touch my body
Oh boy, just touch my body
I mean girl, just touch my body
[Intro]
Ow, baby

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams, I
Think someone's at the door, but I don't think I'ma answer
Police saying "freeze," (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Please, I'm a human being, I have needs
I'm not done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr.
Officer, I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer, I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B
I sing song, it go ring-a-chong, a-ching-chong-chong-chong-ching
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
If I offend, I'm sorry, please, please, forgive
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen an ass like that
Every time I see the show on MTV, my pee-pee goes
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying "freeze," (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
Geez, I just got my seat
I have ticket, look, I put it away, my zipper's zipped
Please do not remove me from this movie theater, please
I did not even get to see Mary-Kate shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great, big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee-wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr.
Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simply plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes, free, right back on the streets
What do you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh 'cause there's a puppet on my hand (Hahaha)

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough, so
I ain't never seen a butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say "ass" and she'll make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo"
I need a new boyfriend, hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying "freeze," (Oh), d-doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, freeze?
My computers will be seized
And my keys to my ranch, I just bake cookies
Mr.
Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me, no, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word "pee-pee"
Pee, on the radio, but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast?
I think I just saw a tit
Psych, I joke, I joke, I kid, I kid
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Arnold, get down

[Chorus]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me, please?
I ain't never seen an ass like that
'Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
D-doing, doing, doing

[Outro: Eminem & Dr. Dre]
Woo
Fuck is wrong with you?
Hah
[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's somethin' I gotta say
For all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way
I've been down that road
And now I'm back, sittin' on square one
Tryin' to pick myself up where I started from

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
I never woulda thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know, between us, we was like mates of soul
Nothin' could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose
'Til more shows, haunted you nights, I suppose
That's how it go: with time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinnin', then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire and—

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine

[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fuckin' clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducin' you to my daughters
'Til you went as far as goin' and snoopin' through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall, I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked, I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started gettin' moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And who'da even knew that?
Who would'a even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them Goddamn darts at me?
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it, it's too hard to see
'Til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach
Up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life-altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring

[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine (Ha-ha)

[Interlude: Stat Quo]
Ha, ha, yeah right, bitch
Spend some time on my dick

[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
In most cases, Stat's attitude is, "Fuck a bitch!"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was different, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
We sufferin' because of this
Shawty on some whole 'nother other shit
Tryin' to play slick, thinkin' I'ma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feedin' you the best of me, I should've fed you piss
We started off closer than close
But who could've predicted to know
Your trifling ways would'a stopped our growth?
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself: "Do I love these hoes?"
— Nope!
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
(Yeah) Em introduced us: "50, this is Tanya, Tanya, this is 50"
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said, "You have very nice lips."
With my imagination, I could see her suckin' my dick
We played the phone game, a week later, shit changed fast
Had her comin' over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan, on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talkin', talkin' like an opportunist too
Why talk, when suckin' my dick is the real career move?
Said she's an aspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah, yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?
(Ha-ha!)
[Hook: Dina Rae & Eminem]
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
I never thought I'd find someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, ‘cause you just crossed the line
Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine
[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But ayy
What'd Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

[Verse 1]
Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it
We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something
We have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright (Heh)

[Verse 2]
It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back
On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Sshh!
Momma's only gone for the moment

[Chorus]
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright

[Post-Chorus]
And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!
(Ha-ha!)
[Intro: Heart (Sampled)]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
But go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me, baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go schizo, I get so insane, I just go schizophrenic
One minute I wanna slit your throat, the next I wanna sex
You make me crazy, the way we act
Like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits
And maybe that's a bad habit
'Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if it's lust or it's love
What's that that's attractin' us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it, you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just 'cause I came home late last night
Crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's, baby
Because you stay with me, maybe 'cause you're as crazy as I am
'Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse: little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24, but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still
You're crazy, sexy, cool, chill
And you play your position, you never step outta line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept outta mine
I wonder what's on your mind
Sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time
I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do, and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply: gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable
Is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me, you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall, you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the word that I'm lookin' for
When I'm tryin' to describe how I feel inside
And the right one just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much, too much is never enough
Maybe 'cause we're crazy in love

[Hook: Heart (Sampled)]
Go crazy on you
Crazy on you
Let me go crazy, crazy on you
*gunshots and crowd hollering*

[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (Oh shit)
What now, nigga?
What now?
What?
Brewster Projects, nigga

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?)
Nigga, fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit!
The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the Saint Andrew's door
(Hey man) ...That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ House Shoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forgot my TEC
I don't see nobody, but Fatt Father and Hex

[Verse 2: Kuniva & (Eminem)]
(Kuniva, you alright?)
These niggas is tripping (Where's Bizarre at?)
(I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wylin'
Two minutes ago, we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier, and she crying
But it's real and it's on and caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and used her body as a human shield and
She got hit, and now she's yelling (Don't leave me!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38, I hope it's not too late!
[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 3: Swift & (Kon Artis)]
(I been trying to call you all day, motherfucker, where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile...what the fuck was that?
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with?
They car?)
With a gat, nigga, and my tire flat
And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?)
I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi (Shit, that's the clique we beefing with!)
Man!
(I swear!)
And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'ma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my AK ain't even tucked
I'ma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!
[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see D12 perform
The fire marshals know the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, 3,000 and some odd
Fans and some cum-wad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun out and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away’s the door
Into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a Mazel Tov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun
And where the fuck is Von?
He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah, I guess not, what the fuck?
Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass, I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again, I can't do it
I scoop Dee, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps, looked up, and I seen Swift shooting it out
But I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his four-fifth

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off

[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left hand, Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although, I can't stay here to fight, 'cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right, bitches, I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (Bitch, bring me a bottle of Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece

[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor, music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off
*People chanting Eminem*
*Eminem tears up a paper*
*Footsteps*
*Door open and slam shut*
*More footsteps*

[Spoken: Slim Shady]
I almost forgot
You're comin' with me

*Gun cocking*

[Spoken: Eminem]
Last one baby, let's go
Last one baby, let's go
Last one baby, let's go

*Eminem sighs*
[Intro: 50 Cent & Eminem]
Sh-sh-sh, Shady!
Aftermath!
Haha!
G-G-G-G, G-Unit!
Haha!
[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor, come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, it’s another club banger
Got ya' hangin’ on the edge of your seat, get on down

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Time’s up, game’s over, you lose, I win
’Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Oh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who’s got you goin’ crazy again
I’m a trend, I set one every time I’m in
I go out, and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means you something that we already had
But once you’re gone, you don’t come back (Oh!)
Too bad, you’re off the map now, radar can’t even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around, just playin’ the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin’ and moanin’, whining and bitchin’
Sit and observe, listen, you’ll learn if you pay attention
Why 10 multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
Worldwide, we’re on the charts with a bullet, and still climbin’

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem, Dr. Dre & 50 Cent]
When Dr. Dre says crunk, you will get it crunk
Get it crunk!
Crunk!
Crunk!
Crunk!
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot, and jump
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
Jump!
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & Eminem]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don’t gotta' promote it, for you to know that Doc is off the benches
We keep the party rockin’ off the hinges
We ain’t showin’ off, we just going off popular consensus
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressin’?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, ’cause Doc left you all guessin’
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?!)
We gon’ have this motherfucker hoppin’ in a second (Bump, bump!)
That’s why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
’Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn’t for rap to bridge the gap may be raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Graced the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the caped crusaders and leave it to me and Dre
To pass the mic and we can play the
Back and forth all day like the hot potato game
That’s why we came to…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
’Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Introduction: Eminem]
50 Cent, come on!
[Verse 3: 50 Cent, Dr. Dre & Eminem]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It’s no secret, everybody know
When Dre’s involved, there’s plenty of money involved
And plenty honey’s involved and sunny Sundays and palm trees
Cali, everyday is just another party
From the valleys all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
Let’s rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre’s about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
You can catch me in the studio, bangin’ out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speakers
So never say never ’cause Shady, Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the
The Doc and Shady, no one can do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a shred of evidence that a…

[Chorus: Eminem & 50 Cent]
We came here to set this party off right
Let’s bounce tonight
And if they don’t let us in through the front
We’ll come through the side
’Cause I don’t ever wanna leave the game
Without at least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Swing one last time

[Outro: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Yeah, haha!
Still Aftermath, 2006!
And don’t worry about that Detox album, it’s comin’… We gon’ make Dre do it!
Haha!
50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre!
We ain’t leaving, let’s go, haha!
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out!
Peace!
*People chanting Eminem’s name*
*Eminem Leaves*
*Slim Shady's Footsteps*
Oh shit!
I almost forgot…
*Girl screams as Shady pulls out a gun*
You’re coming with me!
*Eminem cocks the gun and starts shooting at the audience*
*People start to scream terrified and run*
*Gunshots and shouting*
Ha ha ha.
Bye, bye!
*Eminem shoots himself*
See you in hell, fuckers!
[Intro]
There's an intruder in my house
He cut my phone line: can't dial out (Shit!)
I scream for police, but I doubt
They're gonna hear me when I shout

[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail, but this time
When I get pulled over there's a Doberman Pinscher
And a pit bull in the seat, these pigs'll get bit
Foolin' with me, quit foolin' with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin' that flashlight on my ass — where was you at
Last night when them assholes ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor, kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with, bare palms?
Yeah, right!
They comin' with bombs
I'm comin' with flare guns; we as Americans

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin' beaucoup vests
Drama hangin' over my head, like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you-know-who, with an S tattooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin' quicker
Than makin' paper airplanes out of a twenty
Fuck money!
I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President [dead]
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been "Bastard", the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot — fuck that shit!
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time, they got the fuckin' automatic
Ain't no one gon' test this man — clack (*click*)

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans

[Verse 3]
(Shht!)
I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two ninas under my jeans, either side of my penis
Under my long johns, under my Sean Johns
One run-in with the long arm of the law, I'm long gone
I'ma do five years — no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea that I stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' give me my semi, but I got my weed back

[Chorus]
We as Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin' up in these streets
Through worse and through better health, survivin' by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are Samaritans, what do we get us in?
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live, this is America, and we are Americans
[Intro]
Still love me?
Take this
You ready?
One, two, three!
[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust 'cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other out, we know what it's about, shout
'Til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane, we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do 'cause

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 2]
'Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, 'cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
'Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'til they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, 'cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree 'cause true indeed
If you didn't, I wouldn't be hittin' — yeah, I would
'Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm?
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is 'cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more

[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh, why must we try?
Is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it, yeah!
'Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin'
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent-up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's
"Someone else," problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts 'cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoopla, all of the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of if this is true love
You wouldn't do what you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, 'cause this time, girl, I'm tellin' you what
You do it again, I'm fuckin' you up

[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'ma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
Told me you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me, whore

[Chorus]
The more you put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
'Cause you love me, and I love you more
[Chorus: Eminem]
Once you call my name out, things will never be the same
They should've never let us get our foot in this game

[Verse: Eminem]
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in Juice, I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow just so that
I don't explode, and- have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked, locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas, my dick's so hard Anna
Nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with
Oh shit!
I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'd it (Heheheh!)
Anybody I throw flames at gets a name
It's a game, 'cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame
Every day it's the same thing, people in this game
Try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us, everybody just wants
To have something to do with that
They all trying to get that stamp, they after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common than we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
'Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence, 'cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King 'cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from Columbia
Two years later, me and Doc had to come, and, uhh-
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye-to-eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
I'm still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was hollering "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when they were still making Maxell cassettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head, that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya' don't stop

Whores in this house

Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride

Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me (Yeah)
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me (Yeah)

I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me (Pow, pow, pow)
Talk your shit, bite your lip (Yeah)
Ask for a car while you ride that dick (While you ride that dick)
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang (Yeah)
He already made his mind up 'fore he came (Ayy, ah)
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy (Ah, ah, ah)
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy (Click, click, click)
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy (Mwah, mwah, mwah)
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion]
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me (Yeah, ah)
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo

[Verse 4: Megan Thee Stallion]
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah

[Chorus: Cardi B]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy

Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh

[Intro: Mikael Åkerfeldt]
She told me, why
She told me lies
Always take care of this
I told her how
I've always stayed
Always waiting for nothing

[Verse 1: Mikael Åkerfeldt]
When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I'll find that the years passed us by
When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I'll find that the years passed us by

[Chorus: Mikael Åkerfeldt]
And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes, I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow

[Verse 2: Nathalie Lorichs]
When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You'll find that the years passed us by
When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You'll find that those years passed us by

[Chorus: Nathalie Lorichs]
And I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Yes, I can see you
Running through the fields of sorrow
Long days, slow waste
Sew lies, sow hate

So many years to clean the slate
Endless despair within its wake
His touch soiling what used to be clean
His gaze burning on the edge of our dreams
No more

Long days, long days

And again he rides in
It's September and he covets the gullible
Skeletal wish hunter
A thousand lies, cast from the throne of secrecy
Hear him spewing forth a meaning to miserable lies
See the twisted hand of doubt seal the affair
The insect trust believer
Your body - a vehicle to house his disease

Pearls before swine, they are nothing but blind
Submit to nothing and swallow my spit of scorn
Invisible king, dying
Procession of woe, struck down by sorrow
A burden so great weighs heavy on old and withered beliefs
The swift solution crumbles
Beneath the mock notes of a masterpiece
Death in his eyes, waiting
Spiraling judgment, provoked in the rains

This futile test drowned in the levee of deception
This futile test drowned in the levee of deception

In the year of his sovereign
Rid us of your judgment
Heir Apparent
Liquid is in your throat for hopeless delight
After all you fell in love with death
Life has aborted all you've had and all you became
The night is calling, you pray forth
A barren waste is your land
Crops, they were sown to die
This skin is a mirror, the eyes hollow with ignorance
Health runs from your lips
Sucked in and safe from the world of sleep

All years caring for a liar
The barren drift road is winding higher
You're a moth too close to the fire

You are stuck in a route of confusion
Changing and waiting and seeking the truth of it all

Fleeing your sorrows, pushing your spirit away
Sick of the weakness of the psyche
A whisper from the heart of evil luring them all into despair
Resenting the goods of a saviour
And cries out, for the restless will also die
A selection culled from the damned, drawing a lifeline of one
A friend died in your room and sought the birth of a follower

O brother, you are a killer and you target yourself
I wish you’d never come back for us to see the beckoning end

[Instrumental Break]

And the pride of a mother drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son
And the pride of a mother drawn close in a mother's son
And the love from a father was used by a father's son

Overheard us talking in a smoke of lost hope
The language of a parting so clear and so true
Overheard us talking
[Verse 1]
I once upon a time carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye, a broken rhyme I'd underlined
There's an ocean of sorrow in you

[Break 1]
Sorrow in me

[Verse 2]
Saw a movement in their eyes
Said, I no longer knew the way
Given up the ghost, a passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

[Break 2]
Waiting to fail

[Keyboard Solo]

[Break 3]
Failing again

[Verse 3]
If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear, you've taken more than we've received
And the ocean of sorrow is you

[Guitar Solo]

[Acoustic Guitar Outro]

*Distorted Laughing*
I lost all I had (that April day)
I turned to my friends (nothing to say)
I wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I wallowed in shame

[Instrumental Break]

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promised to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why
Will the children cry when their mother dies?
And in the autumn of their lives will they feel the same?
Uoy ees I, natas teews ym
Thginot kcab emoc, draytruoc eht no tuo
(Out on the courtyard, come back tonight
My sweet satan, I see you)

Her longing for me coming down like hail
Why did you leave me
Come here inside and tell me how
How in my final days
I'd find the rhyme

The light comes on, the signal for us to act out our lives
You wait beneath the white sheets and you wait forever
The light comes on
Your weakness storing trace on your arms
So I left you alone, we all left you alone

Yhw nosaer ruoy regnol on re'yehT
(They're no longer your reason why)

Lock the children away from harm
They're no longer your reason why
Seeking tenderness with a dagger
Skin is marked by the years of trials

You felt abandoned in a flock of friends
Singing praise for the dead
Awaited the face of the moon to ascend
And followed the sound in your head
Two years in your hearts
One moment of doubt
Two lives torn apart
One second from now

Held him in your arms
Your fever subside
Always safe from harm
Kept demons inside

Still you always start running
Towards the light from the moon
Some way mother cried
Left us space here, left us space here
Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Caused me to linger on a piece of text
Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
Then someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, "Thank you"

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here
The sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean

Sun don't shine
The moon don't move the tides
To wash me clean

Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

Cold wind blows
The gods look down in anger
On this poor child

Cold wind blows
Gods look down in anger
On this poor child

Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs
När jag tänker på den ständiga resan
Genom livet
När det alltid känns som höst

Då vänder sej vinden sakta mot norr
Och blommorna dör
Det faller regn i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst

När jag vandrar på den steniga vägen
Genom livet
När det känns som jag bar på en sorg

Då gömmer sej solen sakta i moln
Och ordet är adjö
Snart faller snö i mina drömmar

Jag måste resa igen
Och leta efter tröst
Jag måste leta igen
Efter ömhetens röst

Jag måste resa igen
Till nästa höst
Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst

Den ständiga resan
Till nästa höst
[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny?
Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road (Mmm)
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat (Mmm, yeah)
I say, "I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl"
Some other girl
He says, "What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"

[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
(A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (we never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home
Oh-oh, whoa-oh, oh
(Out of style)

[Chorus]
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (And when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
(Out of the woods)
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
(Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good)
Oh, I remember

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
(Are we?)
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet?
Good
[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Chorus]
(Stay!)
Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!)
Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was stay

[Verse 2]
Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

[Chorus]
(Stay!)
Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!)
Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!
stay!
stay!
stay!
stay!)
[Bridge]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was

[Chorus]
(Stay!)
Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you want to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!)
Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was
(Stay!)
Hey
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay!)
Hey
Now, you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
(All you had to do was stay)
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
(Oh)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
(Ooh)
All you had to do was (Stay!)
[Verse 1]
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm, mmm
That's what people say, mmm, mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm, mmm
That's what people say, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don’t see, mmm, mmm
That's what they don’t see, mmm, mmm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm, mmm
That’s what they don’t know, mmm, mmm

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

[Post-Chorus]
Shake it off, I shake it off

I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, “Oh my God,” but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
(Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmhm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
(And fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus]
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 1]
It's 2AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus 1]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Post-Chorus]
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I

[Bridge]
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I wish I, wish I)

[Verse 3]
2AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

[Chorus 2]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for, and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Outro]
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad, mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I)
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I, I, I, I, I, I wish I, wish I
I wish you would
[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!
[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa (Ah-aah, haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning (Burning) it (It) down (Down)
Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)
(Follow you around)

[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha (Ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-hafhaa)
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That I don't want you to go, oh, oh

[Breakdown]
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say

[Chorus]
'Cause I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (This is how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl)
(That's how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
That's how it works
That's how you got the girl
[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

[Chorus 1]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

[Chorus 2]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

[Chorus 2]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I (I, I, I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Bridge]
They are the hunters, we are the foxes, and we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Outro]
They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)
And you know for me, it's always you (I know places)
In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
And I know for you, it's always me (I know places)
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I-I

[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

[Breakdown]
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

[Outro]
(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean
[Verse 1]
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

[Break]
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
'Bout who you are

[Break]
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
You should be
You should be

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Outro]
I feel so sad
You should be sad
You should be
[Verse 1]
I wanna start this out and say
I gotta get it off my chest (My chest)
Got no anger, got no malice
Just a little bit of regret (Regret)
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

[Pre-Chorus]
No, you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, drugs, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down
And then ran so fucking far
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna start this out by saying (By saying)
I really meant well from the start
Take a broken man right in my hands
And then put back all his parts

[Pre-Chorus]
But you're not half the man you think that you are
And you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars
I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you
'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
Just glad I made it out without breaking down
That you would never ever touch me again
Won't see your alligator tears
'Cause know I've had enough of them

[Outro]
You should be sad
[Verse 1]
So I'm a sinner
Isn't everyone?
Everybody wants to be the god they love
I've seen sweet heaven turn into something else
But I've seen sweet heaven

If it gets you by it's precious
But one thing's playing on my mind

[Chorus]
All this madness
That's out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Verse 2]
Heroes and heroines embrace in the sun
Blind lead the blind as the sighted run
They've seen sweet heaven turn into something else
But they've seen sweet heaven

She could be my drink or poison
But here's what's playing on my mind

[Chorus]
All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold

[Chorus]
All this madness out of nowhere
Your confessions are best untold
I can't leave you now or ever
My resolution has been sold
When the night
Comes falling in your eyes
And you rain your love on me
I feel your heartbeat
Beating next to mine
There's nothing more for me
Let it beat...
When it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you

Alright
When it's alright
I give my life to you
When it's alright
I give my life to you
Alright
When it's alright
Alright
When it's alright
Alright
When it's alright
Alright
When it's alright

Let it beat...
When it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you

When the morning
Comes dawning in your eye
And you rain your love on me
While I'm as helpless
As a cloud up in the sky
You push away my fears
And now you're here

And when it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you
Give my life to you

When it's alright
Give my life to you
When it's alright
Give my life to you
Give my life to you
Give my life to you
When it's alright

Alright
When it's alright
Alright
When it's alright
Alright
When it's alright

Let it beat
When it's alright
The feeling is so good
And when it's alright
I know my heart is understood
And when it's alright
There's nothing I can do
But give my life to you
Give my life to you

To you
To you
To you
To you
To you
To you
To you
Give my life to you
[Verse 1]
What is your angle
Well, I hear your [view?]
I know that you whisper with
The minds that think like you
A mystery lived and breathed
From the day that I could see
Even I've no concept
Of the rage inside of me

[Bridge]
Sweet as the comfort of my
Everlasting peace
No bad religion
Just me and my beliefs
I was my [light?]
And now I am my [word/world?]
[Chorus]
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas

[Verse 2]
Ask me your questions
Take me as you will
No thought can be sacred now
So sacrifice your kill
I see more fear in you
Then I breed within myself
Do you possess existence
And call it something else?
[Bridge]
Sweet as the comfort of my
Realizing [well?]
A misguided trust
Of those who are not
Of this world
I was my [light?]
And now I am my [world?]
[Chorus]
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas
And I've no desire to share my life
With little tin buddhas
[Verse 1]
He sits on the stairs
Waiting for someone to get him
Bring him down to the party
But everyone forgets him
So for times will o stams[?]
and shams the daddy get his mother too
Been good secretly

[Chorus]
Fine young people can still be calloused
And time keeps turning while you're still jealous
That life means nothing while you're still headless
No, time won't wait for no man to come down

[Verse 2]
He steps in his room waiting for someone to call him
Bring him out of his cocoon[?]
waiting for someone to love him
But for times will o stams[?]
and shams the daddy get his mother
Been good once again

[Chorus]
Fine young people can still get calloused
And time keeps turning while you're still jealous
That life means nothing while you're still headless
No time won't wait for no man to come down

Fine young people can still get calloused
And time keeps turning while you're still jealous
That life means nothing while you're still headless
No time won't wait for no man to come down
To come down
[Verse 1]
Moments I make momentarily mine
At moments, I take a step back in time
Each step that I take is leading me to
A time when I felt upset at you

[Verse 2]
Moments I gain, moments I lose
I'm just giving time trying to find
What we had once has been left behind
Here we both stand as it slips through our hands

[Chorus]
We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride

[Verse 3]
Moments we care a little too much
Moments we care are never enough
Clinging to pride, heads held high
What we truly feel, we push to the side

[Verse 4]
Moments we gained are moments we lose
We're just giving time trying to find
What we had once has been left behind
Yet we stand as it slips through our hands

[Chorus]
We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride
That comes before pride

Are we just giving time trying to find?
What we had once has been left behind
And here we stand as it slips through our hands

[Chorus]
We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride

[Chorus]
We know we can
We can survive
Survive the fall
That comes before pride

Moments we gained
Are moments, are moments...
Moments we gained
Are moments we lose
[Out of our heads]

[Verse 1]
Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine remaining your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

[Verse 2]
Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine concerning your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

Back again
Back again

[Verse 3]
Two more fall to the ways of love
With my respect for the man above
Sympathies mine concerning your state
Out of our heads and back again
I'm losing no time for the things I'm told
Ask for silence, let the world explode
Listen to it take away
Out of our heads and back again

Back again
Back again again again again
Back again
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and back again
Out of our heads and
Mhmmm
Mhmmm

[Verse 4]
I have no wish to see you bleed
I'll sacrifice your life for me
Still you lock yourself in chains
Out of our heads and back again
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Our love makes way for untold lust
Concede, our lives can't wait
Out of our heads and back again

Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and

[Verse 5]
Who am I to add lust
I couldn't let you down
The words of sense are hanging on
Leave you shivering on the ground

Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
Out of our heads and
[Verse 1]
You take me over hither[?]
to meet your ex-lover
You let me out of your box every other day
Once upon a month
I used to be a lover in love with you
Now I'm in chains

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I'm just here
And I'm happier than you could ever imagine
Now, I'm here
And I'm happy for being a dreamer

Hey
Nobody told me it would be like this
Hey
Something's gotta be like this

[Chorus]
Nothing getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week

Ah-ah-ah-oh

[Verse 2]
You don't deserve to be writ[?]
about, you're so being
I can't bring myself to say your name
I stopped calling you long ago
And I'm so happy now you'd never know

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, I'm just here
And I'm happier than you could ever imagine
Now, I'm here
And I happy for being a dreamer

Hey
Some things will never be the same
Hey
I'm sick and tired of your singing, singing

[Chorus]
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week

Ah-ah-ah-oh

Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week, but I guess you knew about it
Nothing's getting better and nothing ever changes
Had a bad day all week
Had a bad day all week

Ah-ah-ah-oh
[Verse 1]
When you can smile, and you can cry
When there's no hope yet you find the will to try
Why should you fear, need to change
When people want you for who you are
And you can hurt so much it feels a burning scar
Why should you feel
Why should you feel the need to change

[Chorus]
When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
There's always somebody waiting
To break your fall
To break your fall

[Verse 2]
When I can't see, I can't read
When I know love is living inside of me
Why should I feel the need to change
So I spend all my time
Looking for something else
But now it's clear to me
I've learnt my lesson oh so well
Why did I feel
Tell me why did I feel the need to change

[Chorus]
When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
Just hold onto the branches [?]
Things we are
Just hold onto the branches [?]
[Chorus]
When I have so much more to lose
More than I ever knew
Don't let it go too far
Just hold onto the branches [?]
Things we are
Things we are
Things we are
Things we are
[Verse 1]
We've got our problems
They're not so bad
Sticky situations always stop us from moving ahead
Just a civil feeling....and it feels so right
Where's the need for this indecision?
I don't really want to fight

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Verse 2]
I know nothing is perfect
I see the doubt in your eyes
You're asking me so many questions
I pray that you realize
You don't the meaning
And it hurts me to say
In these games where we hide our feelings
Our problems remain the same

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

[Chorus]
Show a little mercy on me
Give me a chance
You don't have to worry baby
I'll do the rest

Show a little mercy on me
Show a little mercy on me
[Verse 1]
I resign myself to a strange sensation
Of wanting somebody that I can't have
I wish I could believe you relieve my tension
By telling me something I want to hear
But you won't
Will you?
[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

[Verse 2]
I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't help the feelings that I found
Your sentimental touch fills my hear with elation
Are we gonna kick this off the ground?
[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy

[Reprise]
I resign myself to a day of frustration
I can't hide the feelings that I found
And you aren't gonna help me, are you?
[Chorus]
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
So I might be a little melancholy
[Verse 1]
I got my sights set on you and I'm ready to aim
I have a heart that will never be tamed
I knew you were somethin' special
When you spoke my name
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 2]
I've got a way of knowin' when somethin' is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
(I can't wait)
Now I can't wait to see you again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Verse 3]
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs
(That you can't wait)
That you can't wait to see me again

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Bridge]
I got my sights set on you, and I'm ready to aim

[Chorus]
The last time I freaked out
I just kept lookin' down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me
My best friend Lesley said, "Oh, she's just being Miley"
The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again

[Outro]
(To see you again)
(To see you again)
Oh-whoa-whoa, I, I can't wait to see you again
[Verse 1]
My problem isn't that I miss you
'Cause I don't
My problem isn't that I kissed you, whoa
I figured out
That you're nothing that I thought you're about
You're just caught in a place
That soon time will erase in my heart

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

[Verse 2]
Your problem's not for lack of trying
'Cause you do
It's just that you're at your best when you're lying, whoa-oh
Now you're standing here
And saying things you think I wanted to hear
But you've got it all wrong, I've already moved on, my dear

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you

[Bridge]
When you're standing near me
I don't see so clearly
The feelings are still palpable
But when I take two steps away
It sheds some light on my day
Yeah, you can't go back, it's all in the past
Guess you got to laugh at it

[Chorus]
You're my type of guy, I guess
If I was stuck in East Northumberland High for the rest of my life
But people change, thank God I did
And if there's some confusion
Let me tell you, you're just delusional, get a clue
'Cause people change, thank God I did
Thank God I did
Thank God I did

[Outro]
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you, doesn't mean I like you
Just because I liked you back then
It doesn't mean I like you now
Rock 'n roll
Rock 'n…
[Intro]
The weekend's almost done
The moon is low in the sky
I feel like goin' out
Before the night passes by, I won't just sit around
When life becomes a drag
I dance

[Verse 1]
I like the bass (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like the boom (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I need guitar (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
I like that drum when it goes
Boom da-boom da-bum

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need somebody to dance with me, baby (Dance)

[Verse 2]
The music's on (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
My favorite song (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
The beat is strong (Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)
We'll dance
C'mon!
(Ow)

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends (Oh, yeah), grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
Too much rock for one girl can make her go crazy
I need somebody to dance with me, baby (Dance)

[Bridge]
Keep movin'
Back it up
Yeah
When the night says hello
Yeah, get ready to go
Turn it up, turn it loose
Yeah, you got no excuse
Just take a chance (Just take a chance)
Get out on the floor and dance (Let's dance)

[Chorus]
Let's dance
What the weekend, what the night is all about (Dance with me)
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance (Let's dance)
And let's start the party
(Dance with me, dance with me)
(Dance with me, dance)

[Chorus]
Let's dance (Let's dance)
What the weekend, what the night is all about (Is all about)
Let's dance
Grab your girlfriends, grab your boyfriends, sweat it out
Let's dance
Move your whole body, and let's start the party
As soon as my album goes number one
Mr. Lind, I'd like a Rolex with forty diamonds (Ha)
[Verse 1]
Don't call me, leave me alone
Not gonna answer my phone
'Cause I don't, no, I won't see you
I'm out to have a good time
To get you off of my mind
'Cause I don't and I won't need you

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Send out a 9-1-1
(Hoo, hoo) We're gonna have some fun
(Hoo, hoo) Hey boy, you know you better run

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
You better hold tight
This girls night's without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night

[Verse 2]
I'll dance with somebody new
Won't have to think about you
And who knows what let go will lead to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) You'll hear from everyone
(Hoo, hoo) You'll get the 4-1-1
(Hoo, hoo) Hey boy, you knew this day would come

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O, let's go

[Bridge]
Hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
I said, hey, boy
Don't you wish you could've been a good boy?
Try to find another girl like me, boy
Feel me when I tell you
I'm fine and it's time for me to draw the line
(Draw the line, draw the line, draw the line)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's a girls night
It's alright without you
I'm gonna stay out
And play out, without you
You better hold tight
This girls night's without you

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O
(Hoo, hoo) Let's go, G.N.O, let's go
It's a girls night

[Outro]
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo
[Verse 1]
I'll be right here where you need me
Anytime, just keep believin'
And I'll be right here
If you ever need a friend
Someone to care and understand
I'll be right here

[Chorus]
All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

[Verse 2]
Isn't it great that you know that
I'm ready to go wherever you're at?
Anywhere, I'll be there

[Chorus]
All you have to do is call my name
No matter how close or far away
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

[Bridge]
Whenever you need me
There's no need to worry
You know that I'm gonna be right here

[Chorus]
Ask me once and I'll come, I'll come runnin'
And when I can't be with you, dream me near
Keep me in your heart and I'll appear
All you gotta do is turn around, close your eyes, look inside
I'm right here

[Outro]
Oh, yeah, yeah
I'm right here
[Verse 1]
Gonna stay in bed today
'Cause I can't stand the light
Don't know why I get so down
I won't be much fun tonight
And I can't believe
You still want to hang around me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not so pretty all the time
You don't mind
To you, it's alright

[Chorus]
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
I'm lookin' at him

[Verse 2]
I'm not the girl you think you see
But maybe that's a lie
You almost know me better than
Me, myself, and I
Don't know a lot of things
But I know what I got

[Pre-Chorus]
It's not so perfect every day
I don't have to try
'Cause it all falls into place
(It all falls into place)

[Chorus]
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
I'm lookin' at him

[Bridge]
Face to face, eye to eye
You're standin' there
Feels good on the inside
I don't mind, I don't care
You're standin' there
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time
Seein' me for the first time

[Chorus]
As I am is how you take me
Never try to push or make me different
When I talk, you listen to me
As I am is how you want me and
I know I've found the piece that's missin'
(Found the piece that's missin')
I'm lookin' at him

[Outro]
Found the piece that's missin'
Take me as I am
When I talk, you listen
Take me as I am (Yeah)
Found the piece that's missin'
Take me as I am
[Verse 1]
I have to wonder if this wave's too big to ride
Commit or not commit in such a crazy tide

[Pre-Chorus 1]
It's sooner than I thought, but you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

[Verse 2]
Fantastic and romantic, all a big surprise
You got the warning, hesitation pushed aside

[Pre-Chorus 2]
It's sooner than I want, but you caught my heart
I guess I'm ready now to start
I'm gonna start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over

[Bridge]
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy, you disrupt me, can't complain
It's so easy (you disrupt me)
I'm gonna start all over (start all over)

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over

[Chorus]
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget
And start all over
Here I come, straight out of my mind or worse
Another chance to get burned
And start all over
I'm gonna start all over
[Verse 1]
It's 6 a.m. and I'm wide awake
'Cause I can't stop thinkin'
'Bout the stuff you were sayin' to me
And I, I can't let it slide
The paper's not here yet, the sun's not up
But I'm not afraid
To tell you what I feel inside
I had one of those dreams that makes it all so

[Chorus]
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

[Verse 2]
Why did I smile when I hurt inside?
Said I was okay, when I knew it's a lie
I wanted to believe in you
You took your chances and one was me
So I'll just forgive you and set you free
Yeah, I'm on my way
Yeah, I'm stepping out of the haze, and it's so

[Chorus]
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective (Oh, oh)
It's so clear to me now
You can't treat me that way
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

[Bridge]
I wanna put the past behind
Try and maybe I can find better days
The first time in a while
Think I even feel a smile on my face
(Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)
I got a whole new perspective
(Yeah, I do)
(It's so clear)
You can't treat me that way, it's so

[Chorus]
Clear to me now
I got a whole new perspective (So clear)
It's so clear to me now (Now)
You can't treat me that way (So clear)
It appears to me how
Long you tried to make me think
It was me who was being the fake
So clear

[Outro]
Yeah, so clear, so clear, so clear
Sun's going down on a Saturday
And I feel alright, I feel okay
[Verse 1]
Are you overloaded, can't decode it?
Your life's imploding now
There's a risk worth takin', a pain worth achin'
On this hollow ground
(We can) Let go, don't hold onto
All of life's hardest parts
When we think of stoppin', let's keep on rockin'
To the rhythm of our hearts

[Chorus]
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

[Verse 2]
Find the magic, go and grab it
Your fate is in your hands
C'mon, find a reason to believe and
Just tell yourself we can

[Chorus]
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah
We are broken chains, yeah
Good and broken

[Bridge]
Get off your seat, on your feet
Raise your hands, feel the beat
Let it go, lose control
Feel it in your soul
Don't you know what you can do
If you have faith in you?
Let's not be invisible
There's no red light in life, just go

[Chorus]
We can, we can break out of here
Jump on over there
Where the air is clearer
We can, we can forget the pace
Win in our own race
Become a broken chain, yeah (Become a broken chain)
We are broken chains, yeah (We are broken chains)
Good and broken
(We can, we can) Yeah

[Outro]
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
We can, we can, we can, we can
We can
Good and broken
[Intro]
Sha-la-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la-la

[Verse 1]
You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I loved the way you felt so strong

[Pre-Chorus]
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holdin' me

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la, I miss you

[Verse 2]
You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm livin' out my dream
Oh, how I wish you could see
Everything that's happening for me

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinking back on the past
It's true that time is flyin' by too fast

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la, I miss you

[Bridge]
I know you're in a better place, yeah
But I wish that I could see your face, oh
I know you're where you need to be
Even though it's not here with me

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la

[Chorus]
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la, I miss you
[Verse 1]
We are all living the same way, the same way
We are escaping the same way, the same way
Circling (ooh)
We are a part of the same play, the same play
We think we're making our own way, our own way
Circling (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t have to hold your head up high

[Chorus]
Round and round
I won’t run away this time
'Til you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
'Til you show me what this life is for

[Verse 2]
We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling (ooh)
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience, impatiently
Circling (ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You don’t have to hold your head up high

[Chorus]
Round and round
I won’t run away this time
'Til you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
'Til you show me what this life is for

[Bridge]
All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don’t have to make it right
Just hold your head up high

[Chorus]
Round and round
I won’t run away this time (hold your head up high)
'Til you show me what this life is for (hold your head up)
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind (hold your head up high)
'Til you show me what this life is for
[Verse 1]
In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up

[Chorus]
Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

[Verse 2]
I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
But myself

[Chorus]
Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

[Bridge]
Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
For anyone but myself
Reach, it's not as bad as it seems
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
(Love doesn't come 'til you give it up
Love doesn't come 'til you give it up)
[Verse 1]
Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close
Like you wanted me to
Believe in you

[Chorus]
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

[Verse 2]
From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6, the names upon the list
For all the ones who gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free

[Pre-Chorus]
And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close
Like you wanted me to
Believe in you

[Chorus]
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up (Lift me up)
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up (Lift me up)
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry (Oh, oh-oh)
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
[Verse 1]
To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart
Oh, Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation
Tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
That's nice, what a metaphoric fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through the tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

[Chorus]
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

[Verse 2]
This is not what I expect
This is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears
And now they’re crowning me the Caesar

[Pre-Chorus]
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart

[Chorus]
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

[Chorus, Hell and Silence version]
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

[Bridge]
This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

[Chorus]
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene
[Verse 1]
I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?
[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

[Verse 2]
Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I'm here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to fill inside with peace
Like you were here with me

[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

[Bridge]
Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eyes
Is when I need you most
And don't you know?
[Chorus]
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
[Verse 1]
It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

[Refrain]
If you love me, won't you let me know?
[Verse 2]
Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

[Refrain]
And if you love me, won't you let me know?
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

[Refrain]
So if you love me, why'd you let me go?
[Outro]
I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?
[Verse 1]
As far as I can see
All time and circuitry is wrong

As far as poetry
Sit down and sing to me a song

[Chorus]
'Cause all I want in this world
All I want in this world
Is for you to come home

A spell a rebel yell
A spell

[Verse 2]
Soldier come home to me
You've been away from me so long

[Chorus]
And all I want in this world
All I want and deserve
Is for you to come home

[Outro x 2]
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell
A spell a rebel yell

Oh, oh oh oh
[Verse 1]
Just because I'm losing
Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across
Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserve
No better or no worse

[Chorus]
I just got lost
Every river that I've tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Verse 2]
You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won, 'cause along may come
A bigger one

[Chorus]
And you'll be lost
Every river that you try to cross
Every gun you ever held went off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the firing stopped
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
Oh, and I'm just waiting 'til the shine wears off
[Verse 1]
Is our secret safe tonight?
And are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?
[Hook]
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

[Chorus]
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

[Verse 2]
If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside

[Hook]
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it should have been right
It could be wrong, could be wrong, to let our hearts ignite
It could be wrong, could be wrong, are we digging a hole?
It could be wrong, could be wrong, this is out of control
It could be wrong, could be wrong, it can never last
It could be wrong, could be wrong, must erase it fast
It could be wrong, could be wrong, but it could have been right
It could be wrong, could be....

[Chorus]
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

[Outro]
The night has reached its end
We can't pretend
We must run
We must run
It's time to run
Take us away from here
Protect us from further harm
Resistance
[Verse 1]
Is our secret safe tonight?
And are we out of sight?
Or will our world come tumbling down?
Will they find our hiding place?
Is this our last embrace?
Or will the walls start caving in?
[Chorus]
Love is our resistance
They'll keep us apart and they won't stop breaking us down
Hold me
Our lips must always be sealed

[Verse 2]
If we live a life in fear
I'll wait a thousand years
Just to see you smile again
Kill your prayers for love and peace
You'll wake the thought police
We can't hide the truth inside
[Verse 1]
It breaks my heart
To leave you far behind
It breaks me up
To leave so suddenly
Knowing we might never
Meet again
It hurts so much
To lose another friend
I could hope you're just as sad
To see me go

[Verse 2]
But I'd hate to be the cause
Of grief to someone I like so
Knowing we might never
Meet again
It hurts so much
To lose another friend

[Outro]
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart to leave you far behind
To leave

West End girls
West End girls

[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
Sometimes you're better off dead
There's gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head
You think you're mad, too unstable
Kicking in chairs and knocking down tables
In a restaurant in a West End town
Call the police, there's a madman around
Running down underground to a dive bar
In a West End town

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
West End girls

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant (& Helena Springs)]
Too many shadows, whispering voices
Faces on posters, too many choices
If, when, why, what?
How much have you got?
Have you got it, do you get it, if so, how often?
And which do you choose, a hard or soft option?
(How much do you need?)
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls

[Interlude: Helena Springs]
How much do you need?
[Verse 3: Neil Tennant & (Helena Springs)]
You can find a place that no one knows
Where money talks and streets are gold
Someone stands in every door
And if they speak they break the law
("We can work something out
"We can work something out")
Ask a question: blank faces
Read the news and turn the pages
Watch them play a different game
And no one knows your name
No one knows your name

[Verse 4: Neil Tennant (& Helena Springs)]
You've got a heart of glass or a heart of stone
Just you wait 'til I get you home
We've got no future, we've got no past
Here today, built to last
In every city, in every nation
From Lake Geneva to the Finland station
(How far have you been?)
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
In a West End town, a dead end world
The East End boys and West End girls
A West End town, a dead end world

Sooner or later
This happens to everyone

[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
You can live your life lonely
Heavy as stone
Live your life learning
And working alone
Say this is all you want
But I don't believe that it's true
'Cause when you least expect it
Waiting 'round the corner for you

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
You can live a life of luxury
If that's what you want
Taste forbidden pleasures
Whatever you want
You can fly away to the end of the world
But where does it get you to?
'Cause just when you least expect it
Just what you least expect

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling

[Bridge: Neil Tennant]
I know it sounds ridiculous
But speaking from experience
It may seem romantic and that's no defense
Love will always get to you

[Refrain: Neil Tennant]
Sooner or later, sooner or later
This happens to everyone
To everyone

[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
You can fly away to the end of the world
But where does it get you?
[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
Love comes quickly whatever you do
You can't stop falling

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

[Verse 1]
When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

[Chorus]
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

[Verse 2]
At school they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

[Chorus]
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

[Bridge]
Father, forgive me
(I tried not to do it)
Turned over a new leaf
Then tore right through it
(Whatever you taught me)
I didn't believe it
Father, you fought me
'Cause I didn't care
And I still don't understand

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
So I look back upon my life
Forever with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too

It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

[Post-Chorus]
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin

[Outro]
"Confiteor Deo omnipotenti vobis fratres quia peccavi nimis cogitatione, verbo, opere et omissione.
Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa."
Zero!
[Verse 1: Neil Tennant, Dusty Springfield & Both]
You always wanted a lover
I only wanted a job
I've always worked for my living
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?
[Verse 2: Neil Tennant, Dusty Springfield & Both]
I come here looking for money
Got to have it
And end up living with love, oh, oh
Now you left me with nothing
Can't take it
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?
[Pre-Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I bought you drinks, I brought you flowers
I read your books and talked for hours
Every day, so many drinks
Such pretty flowers, so tell me
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I

[Chorus: Dusty Springfield, Neil Tennant & Both]
Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
[Verse 3: Neil Tennant, Dusty Springfield & Both]
You always wanted me to be something I wasn't
You always wanted too much, oh, oh
Now I can do what I want to, forever
How am I gonna get through?
How am I gonna get through?
[Pre-Chorus: Neil Tennant]
At night, the people come and go
They talk too fast and walk too slow
Chasing time from hour to hour
I pour the drinks and crush the flowers
What have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I

[Chorus: Dusty Springfield, Neil Tennant & Both]
Since you went away I've been hanging around
I've been wondering why I'm feeling down
You went away, it should make me feel better
But I don't know, oh
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Tell me
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Baby
How I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
Yeah

[Outro: Dusty Springfield & Neil Tennant]
I'm gonna get through
I'm gonna get through
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
I'm gonna get through, right?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We can make a deal
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't have to fall apart, we don't have to fight
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
We don't need to go to hell and back every night
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I done to deserve this?
What have I, what have I, what have I...

Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Little things I shouldve said and done, I never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, Im so happy that youre mine
If I made you feel second best, Im so sorry, I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasnt died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
Satisfied
Little things I shouldve said and done, I never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasnt died
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
Maybe I didn't treat you quite as good as I should
Maybe I didn't love you quite as often as I could
Maybe I didn't hold you all those lonely, lonely times
And I guess I never told you, Im so happy that youre mine
(maybe I didn't love you...)

(All day, all day)

[Interlude]

[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I've seen you look at strangers too many times
The love you want is of a different kind

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
Remember when we felt the sun?
A love like paradise, how hot it burned
A threat of distant thunder, the sky was red
And when you walked, you always turned every head

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)

[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
I thought that when we fought I was to blame
But now I know you play a different game
I've watched you dance with danger, still wanting more
Add another number to the score

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)

[Bridge: Neil Tennant]
When you look around you wonder
Do you play to win?
Or are you just a bad loser?
[Interlude]

[Refrain: The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
(All day, all day)

[Verse 4: Neil Tennant]
I don't know why, I don't know how
I thought I loved you, but I'm not sure now
I hear the thunder crashing, the sky is dark
And now a storm is breaking within my heart

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & The Voice in Fashion]
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing
(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
(Domino dancing)

(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)

(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down
(All day, all day)
Domino dancing

(All day, all day)
Watch them all fall down

Watch them all fall down

[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
Dictation being forced in Afghanistan
Revolution in South Africa taking a stand
People in Eurasia on the brink of oppression

[Chorus: Neil Tennant]
I hope it's going to be alright
I hope the music plays forever

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
Forests falling at a desperate pace
The earth is dying and desert taking its place
People under pressure on the brink of starvation

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & Tessa Niles]
I hope it's gonna be alright
(Alright, alright, alright)
'Cause the music plays forever
(For it goes on and on and on and on and on)
I hope it's gonna be alright
(On and on and on and on forever)
And the music plays forever
(Alright, alright)

[Verse 3: Neil Tennant]
Generations will come and go
But there's one thing for sure
Music is our life's foundation
And shall succeed all the nations to come

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & Tessa Niles]
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)
'Cause the music plays forever
(For it goes on and on and on and on and on)
I hope it's gonna be alright
(On and on and on and on forever)
And the music plays forever

[Verse 4: Neil Tennant]
The year three thousand may still come to pass
But the music shall last
I can hear it on a timeless wavelength
Never dissipating, but giving us strength

[Chorus: Neil Tennant, Tessa Niles & Chris Lowe]
(It's alright)
I think it's gonna be alright
(It's gonna be)
(Alright, alright, alright, alright)

[Chorus: Neil Tennant & Tessa Niles]
'Cause the music plays forever
(Gonna be alright)
If the music plays forever
(It will be alright)
If the music plays forever

It's gonna be alright
(If the music plays)

[Outro: Tessa Niles]
(It's al... alright)
(It's alright)
(For it goes on and on and on and on)
[Verse 1]
I came across a cache of old photos
And invitations to teenage parties
"Dress in white" one said, with quotations
From someone's wife, a famous writer
In the nineteen-twenties

[Pre-Chorus]
When you're young you find inspiration
In anyone who's ever gone
And opened up a closing door
She said, "We were never feeling bored

[Chorus]
'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end"

[Verse 2]
When I went I left from the station
With a haversack and some trepidation
Someone said, "If you're not careful
You'll have nothing left and nothing to care for
In the nineteen-seventies"

[Pre-Chorus]
But I sat back and looking forward
My shoes were high and I had scored
I'd bolted through a closing door
I would never find myself feeling bored

[Chorus]
'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

[Verse 3]
Now I sit with different faces
In rented rooms and foreign places
All the people I was kissing
Some are here and some are missing
In the nineteen-nineties

[Pre-Chorus]
I never dreamt that I would get to be
The creature that I always meant to be
But I thought in spite of dreams
You'd be sitting somewhere here with me

[Chorus]
'Cause we were never being boring
We had too much time to find for ourselves
And we were never being boring
We dressed up and fought, then thought: "Make amends"
And we were never holding back or worried that
Time would come to an end
We were always hoping that, looking back
You could always rely on a friend

[Outro]
And we were never being boring
We were never being bored
'Cause we were never being boring
We were never being bored
[Intro]
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1]
(Together) We will go our way
(Together) We will leave someday
(Together) Your hand in my hand
(Together) We will make our plans
(Together) We will fly so high
(Together) Tell all our friends goodbye
(Together) We will start life new
(Together) This is what we'll do

[Chorus]
(Go west) Life is peaceful there
(Go west) In the open air
(Go west) Where the skies are blue
(Go west) This is what we're gonna do

[Post-Chorus]
Go west
This is what we're gonna do
Go west

[Verse 2]
(Together) We will love the beach
(Together) We will learn and teach
(Together) Change our pace of life
(Together) We will work and strive
(I love you) I know you love me
(I want you) How could I disagree
(So that's why) I make no protest
(When you say) You will do the rest

[Chorus]
(Go west) Life is peaceful there
(Go west) In the open air
(Go west) Baby, you and me
(Go west) This is our destiny
(Go west) Sun in winter time
(Go west) We will do just fine
(Go west) Where the skies are blue
(Go west, this is what we're gonna do)

[Bridge]
There where the air is free
We'll be what we want to be
(We'll be)
Now if we make a stand
We'll find our promised land
(We'll find)

[Verse 3]
(I know that) There are many ways
(To live there) In the sun or shades
(Together) We will find a place
(To settle) Where there's so much space
(Without rush) And the pace back east
(The hustling) Rustling just to feed
(I know I'm) Ready to leave too
(So that's what) We are gonna do

[Chorus]
(What we're gonna do is go west) Life is peaceful there
(Go west) Here in the open air
(Go west) Where the skies are blue
(Go west) This is what we're gonna do

[Chorus]
(Life is peaceful there)
Go west (In the open air)
Go west (Baby, you and me)
Go west (This is our destiny)
Come on, come on, come on, come on
(Go west) Sun in winter time
(Go west) We will feel just fine
(Go west) Where the skies are blue
(Go west) This is what we're gonna do
(Come on, come on, come on, come on, go west)

[Outro]
(Go west)
(Go west)
(Go west)
The telephone's not answered
So many times you'll call
For many different reasons
So many tears will fall before
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
So many fears will haunt you
Deny them or regret
Some men will make you want to
And you will not forget before
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
There's a story of a man who loved too much
He ended up inside a prison cell
You've got to want to give to get it
Or you could land up in the same suspicious hell
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)
Coincidence and patience
Will mend this fatal flaw
Though it may seem a long wait
Others have been here before
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
One day, when the phone starts ringing
You'll answer to the words you're longing for
No tears, no trade, no prison cell
Whatever you need, he will return more
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
You find your love before
It comes knocking at your door
Before you know for sure
This is what you were waiting for
It's happened before (Before Before Before)
It's happened before (Before Before)
[Chorus 1]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Verse 1]
When you're a boy
Some days are tough
Lying on your bed
Playing punk rock and stuff
Home is a boot camp
You gotta escape
Want to go and wander
In the ticker-tape
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City boy
So young, so run
Into New York City

[Chorus 1]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Verse 2]
The street is amazing
The hoochies unreal
Check out all the hardware
At the latest deal
Hear a song
That's the bomb!
If you don't get the mix
It's gone eighty-six
You feel the deal is real
You're in New York City

[Chorus 1]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Chorus 2]
New York City Boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Interlude]
Then as the evening falls
You can return its calls

[Bridge]
You feel the deal is real
You're a New York City Boy
So young, so run
Into New York City

[Chorus 1]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Chorus 2]
New York City Boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Interlude]
New York City
New York City

[Chorus 1]
New York City Boy
You'll never have a bored day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Chorus 2]
New York City Boy
This is your reward day
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway

[Outro]
'Cause you're a New York City Boy
Where Seventh Avenue meets Broadway
So my baby's on the road
Doing business, selling loads
Charming everyone there
With the sweetest smile

(Chorus)
Oh tonight, I miss you
Oh tonight, I wish you
Could be here with me
But - I won't see you
Till you've made it back again
Home and dry
Home and dry
There's a plane at JFK
To fly you back, from far away
All those dark, and frantic
Transatlantic miles

(Chorus)
Oh tonight, I miss you
Oh tonight, I wish you
Could be here with me
But - I won't see you
Till you've made it back again
Home and dry
Home and dry
Far away
Through night and day
You fly long haul, tonight
Come to me
You know, I'll be here
When you call tonight

(Chorus)
Oh tonight, I miss you
Oh tonight, I wish you
Could be here with me
But - I won't see you
Till you've made it back again
Home and dry
Home and dry
Home and dry
Home and dry

You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more

[Verse 1: Neil Tennant]
Boy, it's tough getting on in the world
When the sun doesn’t shine
And a boy needs a girl
It's about getting out of a rut
You need luck
But you're stuck and you don’t know how

[Chorus 1: Neil Tennant (& Xenomania)]
(Don't have to be)
A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don't have to drive)
A super car to get far
(Don't have to live)
A life of power and wealth
(Don't have to be)
Beautiful but it helps
(Don't have to buy)
A house in Beverly Hills
(Don't have to have)
Your daddy paying the bills
(Don't have to live)
A life of power and wealth
(Don’t have to be)
Beautiful but it helps

[Post-Chorus 1: Neil Tennant (& Xenomania)]
(You need more)
Than a big blank check to be a lover, or
A Gulfstream jet to fly you door to door
Somewhere chic on another shore
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need love

[Interlude: Neil Tennant]
You need love
You need love

[Bridge: Neil Tennant]
Too much of anything is never enough
Too much of everything is never enough

[Verse 2: Neil Tennant]
Boy, it’s tough getting on in the world
When the sun doesn't shine
And a boy needs a girl
It’s about getting out of a rut
You need luck but you're stuck
And you don't know how

[Chorus 2: Neil Tennant (& Xenomania)]
(Don't have to be)
A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don’t have to drive)
A super car to get far
(Don't have to wear)
A smile much colder than ice
(Don't have to be)
Beautiful, but it's nice

[Post-Chorus 2: Neil Tennant (& Xenomania)]
(You need more)
Than the Gerhard Richter hanging on your wall
A chauffeur driven limousine on call
To drive your wife and lover to a white tie ball
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need more
You need love

[Coda: Neil Tennant (& Xenomania)]
I believe
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
That we can achieve
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
The love that we need
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
I believe
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
Call me naive
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
(You need more)
That love is for free
(You need more)

[Chorus 3: Neil Tennant (& Xenomania)]
(Don't have to be)
A big bucks Hollywood star
(Don't have to drive)
A super car to go far
(Don't have to live)
A life of power and wealth
(Don't have to be)
Beautiful...
[Verse 1]
Small man, big world
Lost beyond the pale
I know you
Inside out
I can tell the tale

[Verse 2]
Across the sky
The change of time
Last night I lost all day
I'm here and there
I'm anywhere
Away from Manderley

[Chorus]
And if I were
The king of Rome
I couldn't be more tragic
My fate to roam
So far from home
In search of my last magic

[Refrain]
Oh, baby come back
Oh, baby come back to me

[Verse 3]
The desert moon
A new lagoon
We glide upon the surface
Night falls fast
My shadow's cast
Arriving with a purpose

[Refrain]
Oh, baby call me
Oh, baby call me today

[Chorus]
And if I were
The king of Rome
I couldn't be more lonely
With so much scope
To dream and hope
Someday you'll deign to phone me

[Refrain]
Oh, baby call me
Oh, baby call me today

[Outro]
I long for your inscrutable, pale face
I hunger for your beautiful embrace
[Verse 1]
I don't wanna talk
About things we've gone through
Though it's hurting me, now it's history
I've played all my cards
And that's what you've done, too
Nothing more to say, no more ace to play

[Chorus]
The winner takes it all
The loser's standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

[Verse 2]
I was in your arms
Thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense, building me a fence
Building me a home
Thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

[Chorus]
The gods may throw a dice
Their minds as cold as ice
And someone way down here
Loses someone dear
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)
The loser has to fall (Has to fall)
It's simple and it's plain (It seems plain)
Why should I complain?
(Why complain)

[Verse 3]
But tell me, does she kiss
Like I used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name?
Somewhere deep inside
You must know I miss you
But what can I say?
Rules must be obeyed

[Chorus]
The judges will decide (They decide)
The likes of me abide (We abide)
Spectators of the show (Of the show)
Always staying low (Staying low)
The game is on again (On again)
A lover or a friend (Or a friend)
A big thing or a small (Big or small)
The winner takes it all (Takes it all)

[Verse 4]
I don't wanna talk
If it makes you feel sad
And I understand, you've come to shake my hand
I apologise
If it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense, no self-confidence

[Bridge]
But you see, the winner takes it all
The winner takes it all

[Outro]
(So the winner)
(Takes it all)
(And the loser)
(Has to fall)
(Throw a dice)
(Cold as ice)
(Way down here)
(Someone dear)
(Takes it all)
(Has to fall)
(It seems plain)
(Why complain)
[Intro: Frida & Agnetha]
Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
Like I always do
'Cause somewhere in the crowd, there's you

[Verse 1: Frida]
I was sick and tired of everything
When I called you last night from Glasgow
All I do is eat and sleep and sing
Wishing every show was the last show
(Wishing every show was the last show)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
So imagine I was glad to hear you're coming
(Glad to hear you're coming)
Suddenly I feel all right
(And suddenly it's gonna be)
And it's gonna be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

[Verse 2: Frida]
Facing twenty thousand of your friends
How can anyone be so lonely?
Part of a success that never ends
Still, I'm thinking about you only
(Still, I'm thinking about you only)

[Pre-Chorus: Frida]
There are moments when I think I'm going crazy
(Think I'm going crazy)
But it's gonna be all right
(You'll soon be changing everything)
Everything will be so different
When I'm on the stage tonight

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

[Bridge: Frida]
So I'll be there when you arrive
The sight of you will prove to me I'm still alive
And when you take me in your arms and hold me tight
I know it's gonna mean so much tonight

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
Tonight, the Super Trouper lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
'Cause somewhere in the crowd there's you

[Outro: Frida & Agnetha, Benny & Björn]
(Sup-p-per Troup-p-per) Lights are gonna find me
Shining like the sun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Smiling, having fun (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Feeling like a number one
Tonight, the Super Trouper beams are gonna blind me
But I won't feel blue
But I won't feel blue (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
Like I always do… (Sup-p-per Troup-p-per)
[Verse 1]
My, my - at Waterloo, Napoleon did surrender
Oh, yeah - and I have met my destiny in quite a similar way

[Pre-Chorus]
The history book on the shelf
Is always repeating itself

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Verse 2]
My, my - I tried to hold you back, but you were stronger
Oh, yeah - and now it seems my only chance is giving up the fight

[Pre-Chorus]
And how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Chorus]
Waterloo, I was defeated, you won the war
Waterloo, promise to love you forevermore
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo

[Pre-Chorus]
So how could I ever refuse?
I feel like I win when I lose

[Outro]
Waterloo, couldn't escape if I wanted to
Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Waterloo
Finally facing my Waterloo
Woo, Waterloo, knowing my fate is to be with you
[Verse 1]
Half-past twelve
And I'm watching the late show in my flat, all alone
How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Verse 2]
Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of TV
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

[Bridge]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

[Chorus]
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
[Verse 1: Agnetha & Frida]
I've seen you twice, in a short time
Only a week since we started
It seems to me, for every time
I'm getting more open-hearted

[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
I was an impossible case
No one ever could reach me
But I think I can see in your face
There's a lot you can teach me
So I wanna know

[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
What's the name of the game?
Does it mean anything to you?
What's the name of the game?
Can you feel it the way I do?
[Post-Chorus: Frida]
Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

[Bridge: Frida & Agnetha]
And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down?
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you?
(Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
The name of the game

[Verse 2: Agnetha & Frida]
I have no friends, no one to see
And I am never invited
Now I am here, talking to you
No wonder I get excited

[Pre-Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
Your smile, and the sound of your voice
And the way you see through me
Got a feeling, you give me no choice
But it means a lot to me
So I wanna know

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida & Björn]
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Does it mean anything to you?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
[Post-Chorus: Frida]
Tell me, please, 'cause I have to know
I'm a bashful child beginning to grow

[Bridge: Frida, Agnetha & Frida]
And you make me talk (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me feel (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
And you make me show (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
What I'm trying to conceal (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I trust in you (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you let me down?
(Doo-doo, doo-doo)
Would you laugh at me (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
If I said I care for you?
(Ah-ah)
Could you feel the same way too, I wanna know
Oh, yes, I wanna know

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida & Björn]
The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?
(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it the way I do?
(Got a feeling you give me no choice, but it means a lot)

[Chorus: Agnetha, Frida & Björn]
The name of the game
(I was an impossible case)
Does it mean anything to you?
(But I think I can see in your face that it means a lot)
What's the name of the game?
(Your smile and the sound of your voice)
Can you feel it...
[Verse 1]
I was sitting by the phone
I was waiting all alone
Baby by myself I sit and wait and wonder about you
It's a dark and dreary night
Seems like nothing's going right
Won't you tell me honey how can I go on here without you?
[Pre-Chorus]
Yes I'm down and feeling blue
And I don't know what to do, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
[Verse 2]
You were here and now you're gone
Hey, did I do something wrong?
I just can't believe that I could be so badly mistaken
Was it me or was it you?
Tell me, are we really through?
Won't you hear me cry and you will know that my heart is breaking

[Pre-Chorus]
Please forgive and then forget
Or maybe darling better yet, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Ring, ring, the happiest sound of them all
Ring, ring, I stare at the phone on the wall
And I sit all alone impatiently
Won't you please understand the need in me
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
[Outro]
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
Oh-oh, ring, ring, why don't you give me a call?
So, ring, ring...
[Verse 1]
Love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

[Chorus]
Oh, I've been dreaming through my lonely past
Now I just made it, I found you at last

[Verse 2]
So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, no hard feelings between you and me
If we can't make it, but just wait and see

[Verse 3]
So come on, now let's try it, I love you, can't deny it
'Cause it's true, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
So love me or leave me, make your choice but believe me
I love you, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
I can't conceal it, don't you see, can't you feel it?
Don't you too?
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do
[Verse 1]
Where are those happy days?
They seem so hard to find
I tried to reach for you, but you have closed your mind
Whatever happened to our love?
I wish I understood
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good

[Chorus]
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me?
S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?
[Verse 2]
You seem so far away though you are standing near
You made me feel alive, but something died I fear
I really tried to make it out, I wish I understood
What happened to our love?
It used to be so good

[Chorus]
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me?
S.O.S
The love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?
[Interlude]

[Chorus]
So when you're near me, darling, can't you hear me?
S.O.S
And the love you gave me, nothing else can save me, S.O.S
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?
[Outro]
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on?
When you're gone, though I try, how can I carry on?
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
I remember, long ago, another starry night like this
In the firelight, Fernando
You were humming to yourself and softly strumming your guitar
I could hear the distant drums and sounds of bugle calls were coming from afar

[Verse 2]
They were closer now, Fernando
Every hour, every minute seemed to last eternally
I was so afraid, Fernando
We were young and full of life and none of us prepared to die
And I'm not ashamed to say the roar of guns and cannons almost made me cry

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though we never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Verse 3]
Now we're old and grey, Fernando
Since many years I haven't seen a rifle in your hand
Can you hear the drums, Fernando?
Do you still recall the fateful night we crossed the Rio Grande?
I can see it in your eyes, how proud you were to fight for freedom in this land

[Chorus]
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
There was something in the air that night
The stars were bright, Fernando
They were shining there for you and me
For liberty, Fernando
Though I never thought that we could lose
There's no regret
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
Yes, if I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando

[Outro]
If I had to do the same again
I would, my friend, Fernando
[Verse 1]
Where is the spring and the summer
That once was yours and mine?
Where did it go?
I just don't know
But still, my love for you will live forever

[Chorus]
Hasta Mañana till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then

[Verse 2]
Where is the dream we were dreaming
And all the nights we shared?
Where did they go?
I just don't know
And I can't tell you just how much I miss you

[Chorus]
Hasta Mañana till we meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
Darling, our love was much too strong to die
We'll find a way to face a new tomorrow
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then

[Outro]
Hasta Mañana, say we'll meet again
I can't do without you
Time to forget, send me a letter
Say you forgive, the sooner the better
Hasta Mañana, baby
Hasta Mañana, until then
[Verse 1]
I've been cheated by you since I don't know when
So I made up my mind: it must come to an end
Look at me now, will I ever learn?
I don't know how, but I suddenly lose control
There's a fire within my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again?
My my, just how much I've missed you
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go

[Verse 2]
I've been angry and sad about things that you do
I can't count all the times that I've told you we're through
And when you go, when you slam the door
I think you know that you won't be away too long
You know that I'm not that strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Just one look and I can hear a bell ring
One more look and I forget everything, whoa

[Chorus]
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, even if I say
"Bye-bye", leave me now or never
Mamma mia, it's a game we play
"Bye-bye" doesn't mean forever
Mamma mia, here I go again
My my, how can I resist you?
Mamma mia, does it show again
My my, just how much I've missed you?
Yes, I've been broken-hearted
Blue since the day we parted
Why, why did I ever let you go?
Mamma mia, now I really know
My my, I could never let you go
[Verse 1]
I wasn't jealous before we met
Now every woman I see is a potential threat
And I'm possessive, it isn't nice
You've heard me saying that smoking was my only vice

[Pre-Chorus]
But now it isn't true
Now everything is new
And all I've learned has overturned
I beg of you

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 2]
It was like shooting a sitting duck
A little small talk, a smile, and baby, I was stuck
I still don't know what you've done with me
A grown-up woman should never fall so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel a kind of fear
When I don't have you near
Unsatisfied, I skip my pride
I beg you, dear

[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me

[Verse 3]
I've had a few little love affairs
They didn't last very long and they've been pretty scarce
I used to think that was sensible
It makes the truth even more incomprehensible

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause everything is new
And everything is you
And all I've learned has overturned
What can I do?
[Chorus]
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go sharing your devotion
Lay all your love on me
Don't go wasting your emotion
Lay all your love on me
[Verse 1]
I'm nothing special, in fact I'm a bit of a bore
If I tell a joke, you've probably heard it before
But I have a talent, a wonderful thing
'Cause everyone listens when I start to sing
I'm so grateful and proud
All I want is to sing it out loud

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it?
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Verse 2]
Mother says I was a dancer before I could walk
Mhm, she says I began to sing long before I could talk
And I've often wondered, how did it all start?
Who found out that nothing can capture a heart
Like a melody can?
Well, whoever it was, I'm a fan

[Chorus]
So I say thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it?
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Bridge]
I've been so lucky
I am the girl with golden hair
I wanna sing it out to everybody
What a joy, what a life, what a chance

[Chorus]
Thank you for the music, the songs I'm singing
Thanks for all the joy they're bringing
Who can live without it?
I ask in all honesty
What would life be?
Without a song or a dance, what are we?
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me

[Outro]
So I say thank you for the music, for giving it to me
[Verse 1]
No more champagne
And the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you
Feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party
And the morning seems so grey
So unlike yesterday
Now's the time for us to say

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I see
How the brave new world arrives
And I see how it thrives
In the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool
And he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on, feet of clay
Never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I

[Verse 3]
Seems to me now
That the dreams we had before
Are all dead, nothing more
Than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade
In another ten years time
Who can say what we'll find
What lies waiting down the line
In the end of eighty-nine

[Chorus]
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbour is a friend
Happy new year, happy new year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't we might as well lay down and die
You and I
[Vers 1: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, underbara, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, söta rara, aha, honey honey
Dom viskar så söta ord
Du är deras allt på jord
Det där ska du inte tro, bara ta det med ro
Sen är bara smicker

[Vers 2: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, inte illa, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, flicka lilla, aha, honey honey
Den kvarnen som mal är tom
Och det är en ynkedom
Nej, killar som snackar så litar ingen på

[Refräng: Björn and Agnetha & Frida]
Det brukar va' dom som sviker, som ivrigast hållit me'
Men vet man det bara så kan man nog klara det
Tro inte på önskesmicker, och passa dej vad du gör
Och håll dej med benen på jorden, ja, vad du än hör

[Vers 3: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, viskar alla, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, lätt att falla, aha, honey honey
Men tro bara det du vill
Och lägg inte märke till
Det söta du alltid hör, som så många gör

[Refräng: Björn and Agnetha & Frida]
Tro inte på smicker, nej, passa dej vad du gör
Ja, håll dig med benen på jorden, ja, vad du än hör

[Vers 4: Agnetha & Frida]
Honey, honey, underbara, aha, honey honey
Honey, honey, söta rara, aha, honey honey
Men socker är inte allt
Så ta't me' en nypa salt
Och är du förståndig se'n, tar du inte en
Nej, de tar du me

Les livres d'histoire et la vie
Racontent la même comédie

[Strophe 1]
Ich bin ganz allein zu haus
Sowas hält doch keiner aus
Deine Eifersucht, die ist doch blöd und albern und dumm nur!
Baby, treib es nicht zu weit
Immer wieder machst du Streit
Kannst du mir mal sagen, du, wieso, weshalb und warum nur?
[Pre-Refrain]
Auch bei mir reißt mal der Draht
Häng dich an den Apparat, oh

[Refrain]
Ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei
Ring, ring, telefonier’, es ist frei
Ring.
ring, sonst ist es aus und vorbrei
Geh doch endlich mal ran ans Telefon
Sag doch endlich: Komm an, ich warte schon
Oh, ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei
Oh, ring, ring sonst ist es aus und vorbei

[Strophe 2]
Sag mir nicht, dir fehlt die Zeit
Oder die Gelegenheit
Denn es gibt hier doch an jeder Straßenecke eine Zelle
Sag mir nicht, daß es nicht paßt
Weil du keine Groschen hast
Denn in jeder Post in jeder Bank ist eine Wechselstelle

[Pre-Refrain]
Auch bei mir reißt mal der Draht
Häng dich an den Apparat, oh

[Refrain]
Ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei
Ring, ring, telefonier’, es ist frei
Ring, ring, sonst ist es aus und vorbrei
Geh doch endlich mal ran ans Telefon
Sag doch endlich: Komm an, ich warte schon
Oh, ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei
Oh, ring, ring sonst ist es aus und vorbei

[Outro]
Oh, ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei
Oh, ring, ring sonst ist es aus und vorbei
Oh, ring, ring sonst ist es aus und vorbei
Oh, ring, ring, vierzehn-null-sieben-null-drei
Oh, ring, ring sonst ist es aus und vorbei
[Letra de "¡Dame!
¡Dame!
¡Dame!"]
[Verso 1]
El reloj
Ya marcó medianoche, y otra vez encontré
Que tan sólo me acompaña la TV
El soplar
De ese viento afuera, vive la desolación
Me oprime con angustia el corazón

[Prestribillo]
No hay más que soledad
Nadie, ni por piedad

[Estribillo]
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Alguien que me ayude a las sombras borrar
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Hasta que amanezca, ver el dí­a aclarar

[Verso 2]
Tantos hay
Con gran suerte y fortuna, todo pueden conseguir
Tan distinto a lo que tengo que vivir
Aburrida
Me encuentro esta noche y la gran oscuridad
Es mi siempre obligada amistad

[Prestribillo]
No hay más que soledad
Nadie, ni por piedad

[Estribillo]
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Alguien que me ayude a las sombras borrar
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Hasta que amanezca, ver el dí­a aclarar

[Puente]
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
[Interludio]

[Prestribillo]
No hay más que soledad
Nadie, ni por piedad

¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Alguien que me ayude a las sombras borrar
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Hasta que amanezca, ver el dí­a aclarar
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Alguien que me ayude a las sombras borrar
¡Dame, dame, dame amor esta noche!
Hasta que amanezca, ver el dí­a aclarar
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
Welcome to my world
Step right through the door
Leave your tranquillizers at home
You don't need them anymore
All the drama queens are gone
And the devil got dismayed
He packed up and fled this town
His master plan delayed

[Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
And if you stay a while
I'll penetrate your soul
I'll bleed into your dreams
You'll want to lose control
I'll weep into your eyes
I'll make your visions see
I'll open endless skies
And ride your broken wings

[Chorus 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcomе to my world

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
Watch the sunrise set
And thе moon begin to blush
And make it in a search
Translucently too much
And I hold you in my arms
I keep you by my side
And we sleep the devil's sleep
Just to keep him satisfied "Oh, yeah!"
[Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
And if you stay a while
I'll penetrate your soul
I'll bleed into your dreams
You'll want to lose control
I'll weep into your eyes
I'll make your visions see
I'll open endless skies
And ride your broken wings

[Chorus 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
The angel of love was upon me
And lord I felt so small
The legs beneath me weaken
I began to crawl
Confused and contented
I slithered around
Reveal is beyond me
I was lost I was found

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
The angel of love was upon me
And lord I felt so weak
I felt my tongue move in my mouth
And I began to speak
A strange kind of language
I don't understand
A babbling fountain
I couldn't have planned

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin Gore]
Oh leave me here forevermore
I've found the peace I've been searching for
"Yeaah!"
[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
The angel of love was upon me
And lord I felt so high
I swear I could've reached up
Place my hands upon the sky
A radiant rainbow
Was following me around
With elevated senses
I can see and taste sound

[Interlude]

[Verse 4: Dave Gahan]
The angel of love was upon me
And lord I felt so clean
Like a preacher on Sunday
My heart was serene
I waded into the water
I was bathed, I was drowned
Like the sinners before me
I knelt down on the ground

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin Gore]
Oh leave me here forevermore
I've found the peace I've been searching for "Oh, yeah"
Oh let me sleep forevermore
I've found the peace I've been searching for

[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Thank you very much!"
"Thank you!"
"Good evening, Berlin!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I would tell you about the things they put me through
The pain I've been subjected to
But the Lord himself would blush
The countless feasts laid at my feet
Forbidden fruits for me to eat
But I think your pulse would start to rush

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Now I'm not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes

[Chorus: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
Morality would frown upon
Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fate's made of me
But I promise now, my judge and jurors
My intеntions couldn't have been purer
My case is еasy to see

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore, (audience)]
I'm not looking for a clearer conscience
Peace of mind after what I've been through
And before we talk of any repentance
(Try walking in my shoes) "What?!"
(Try walking in my shoes)

[Chorus: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my...
Oh, shoes

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore, (audience)]
Now I'm not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
(Try walking in my shoes) "Come on, let's hear it!"
(Try walking in my shoes)

[Chorus: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my...
My shoes
"Christian!"
[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Thank you very much."
"Thank you."
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
Precious and fragile things
Need special handling
My God, what have we done to you?
We always tried to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put you through

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Things get damaged, things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Angels with silver wings
Shouldn’t know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes Hе's seeing through

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Things get damaged, things get brokеn
I thought we’d manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
"Martin!"
[Interlude]

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
I pray you learn to trust
Have faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Things get damaged, things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
"Oh, yeah!"
[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Thank you!"
[Intro: Daniel Miller]
A brief period of rejoycing

[Chorus: Dave Gahan]
Let's have a black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight

[Post-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day

[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I look to you, how you carry on
When all hope is gone, can't you see?
Your optimistic eyes seem like paradise
To someone like me

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dave Gahan]
I want to take you in my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today

[Chorus: Dave Gahan, (Martin L. Gore)]
(Black celebration) "Sing it!"
(Black celebration)
Tonight

[Post-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day

[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
"Yеah!"
"Eh!"
[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
I look to you and your strong belief
Me, I want rеlief tonight
Consolation, I want so much
Want to feel your touch tonight

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dave Gahan]
Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldn't do today

[Chorus: Dave Gahan, (Martin L. Gore), {audience}]
(Black celebration) "Sing it, come on!"
{Black celebration} (Tonight)
Black celebration (I'll drink to that)
Black celebration (Tonight)
Black celebration (I'll drink to that)
Black celebration (Tonight)


[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Thank you!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I dream of a day
When I dare to believe
You're the answer
When the shame
And the guilt are removed
And the truth appears
With the touch of your hand
I lose who I am
If I want to
I tried to resist
But succumb to the bliss
Of your kiss

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
You should be higher
I'll take you higher
So don't be afraid
You'll just have to pray

[Chorus: Dave Gahan]
Your lies are more attractive
Than the truth
Love is all I want
Your lies are written down
In your book
Love is all I want "Yeah."
[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Your arms are infected
They are holding the truth
Oh stop all your crying
This one you'll lose

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
You should be higher
I'll take you higher
So don't be afraid
You'll just have to pray

[Chorus: Dave Gahan]
Your lies are more attractive
Than the truth
Love is all I want
Your lies are written down
In your book
Love is all I want "Yeah."
[Post-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
You should be higher
You should be higher

[Outro: Dave Gahan, (audience)]
Love
Love "Come on!"
Love "Let's hear it!"
(Love) "Alright!"
Love
(Love) "Alright!"
Love "Berlin!"
(Love)
"Thank you!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
You had something to hide
Should have hidden it, shouldn't you?
Now you're not satisfied
With what you're being put through

[Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
It's just time to pay the price
For not listening to advice
And deciding in your youth
On the policy of truth

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
Things could be so different now
It used to be so civilised
You will always wonder how
It could have been if you'd only lied

[Chorus 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
It's too late to change events
It's time to face the consequence
For delivering the proof
In the policy of truth "Wooo!
Alright!"
[Post-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
"Yeah, that's right!"
[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
Now you're standing there tongue-tied
You'd better learn your lesson well
Hide what you have to hide
And tell what you have to tell
"Alright, let's hear it!."
[Chorus 3: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
You'll see your problems multiplied
If you continually decide
To faithfully pursue
The policy of truth

[Post-Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before
"Oh, that's right!"
"Alright, let's go!"
"Yeah!"
"Yeah!"
[Outro: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before "Ah!"
Never again is what you swore
The time before
Never again is what you swore
The time before "Yeah, that's right!"
[Verse 1: Martin L. Gore]
There is darkness and death in your eyes
What have you got buried inside?
The shallow grave in your soul
The ghosts that have taken control

[Chorus 1: Martin L. Gore]
You really should have dug a little deeper there
Body parts are starting to appear and scare
The child inside away

[Verse 2: Martin L. Gore]
Each tear that flows down your face
Trickles then picks up the pace
And turns to a river inside
A river that will not subside

[Chorus 2: Martin L. Gore]
I can hear that dreadful overflowing sound
And watching from afar I see a child is drowned
The child inside your heart

[Bridge: Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
I can see you drifting away
Hеading for the light
I can see you drifting away
Every night

[Verse 3: Martin L. Gore]
Why werе you always inside?
On days when the weather was fine
And while we were running around
You were nowhere to be found

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
You know you should have taken all your dolls to bed
Well you were made to play games with your soul instead
The child inside you died
[Verse 1: Martin L. Gore]
Oh God, it's raining, but I'm not complaining
It's filling me up with new life
The stars in the sky bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
And I haven't felt so alive
In years

[Verse 2: Martin L. Gore]
Just for a day on a day like today
I'll get away from this constant debauchery
The wind in my hair makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
And I haven't felt so alive
In years

[Chorus 1: Martin L. Gore]
The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight

[Verse 3: Martin L. Gore]
Oh God, it's raining and I'm not containing
My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own, all on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
And I haven't felt so alive
In years

[Chorus 2: Martin L. Gore]
The moon is shining in the sky
Reminding me of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
I'd been mistaken for dead
But not tonight

[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Let's give it up for mister Martin L. Gore!
And mister Peter Gordeno!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Sometimes I slide away
Silently
I slowly lose myself
Over and over
Take comfort in my skin
Endlessly
Surrender to my will
Forever and ever

[Chorus 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I dissolve in trust
I will sing with joy "Wooh!"
I will end up dust
I'm in heaven

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I stand in golden rays
Radiantly
I burn a fire of love
Over and over
Reflecting endless light
Relentlessly
I have embraced the flame
Forever and ever

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I will scream Thе Word
Jump into the void "Oh, yeah."
I will guide thе herd
Up to heaven "Yeah."
[Outro: Dave Gahan]
I still love you
I still love you
"Thank you."
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I'm coming for you
When the sun goes down
I'm coming for you
When there's no one around

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dave Gahan]
I come to your house
Break down the door
Girl I'm shaking
And I need more

[Chorus: Dave Gahan, (Martin L. Gore)]
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Alright, alright

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
I'm coming for you
I need to feel your skin
I'm coming for you "Woooh!"
To stop this crawling

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dave Gahan]
I'm taking my place
By your side "Woah!"
I'm not leaving
Until I'm satisfied "Come on!"
[Chorus: Dave Gahan, (Martin L. Gore)]
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Alright, alright

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
I'm coming for you
My body's hungry
I'm coming for you
Like a junkie

[Pre-Chorus 3: Dave Gahan]
I can't stop
The desire in me "Woooh!"
I'm not waiting
Patiently "Come on!"
[Chorus: Dave Gahan, (Martin L. Gore)]
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
"Hey!"
There's only one way to soothe my soul
(There's only one way to soothe my soul!)
"Alright!"
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
Only one way (Only one way!)
[Outro: Dave Gahan & Martin Gore]
There's only one way...
To...
Soothe...
My...
My...
My...
Soul
"Woooh!"
"Don't stop!"
"Don't stop!
I said; don't stop!"
"Wooooh!
Wow, thank you very much."
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I'm not sure what I'm looking for anymore
I just know that I'm harder to console
I don't see who I'm trying to be instead of me
But the key is a question of control

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Can you say what you're trying to play anyway?
I just pay while you're breaking all the rules
All the signs that I find have been underlined
Devils thrive on the drive that is fueled
"Ah!"
[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
All this running around, well, it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
There's a hole in your soul like an animal
With no conscience repentance unknown
Close your eyes, pay the price for your paradise
Devils feed on the seeds that are sown
"Ah!"
[Verse 4: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I can't conceal what I feel, what I know is real
No mistaking the faking, I care
With a prayer in the air, I will leave it there
On a note full of hope not despair

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
All this running around, well, it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true
All this running around, well, it's getting me down
Just give me a pain that I'm used to
I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive
You just need to achieve something that rings true

[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Thank you!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I've got to get to you first
Before they do
It's just a question of time
Before they lay their hands on you
And make you just like the rest
I've got to get to you first
It's just a question of time

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
Well, now you're only fifteen "Wooh!"
And you look good
I'll take you under my wing
Somebody should
They've persuasive ways
And you'll believe what they say

[Chorus: audience, "Dave Gahan"]
"Sing it!"
It's just a question of time
And it's running out for you
It won't be long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to "No!"
[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
I can see them now "Eh..."
Hanging around "Ah!"
To mess you up "Woooh!"
To strip you down
And have their fun
With my little one

[Chorus: audience, "Dave Gahan"]
"Sing it!"
It's just a quеstion of time
And it's running out for you
It won't be long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to
It won't bе long until you'll do
Exactly what they want you to "No!"
[Verse 4: Dave Gahan]
Sometimes I don't blame them
For wanting you
You look good "Oh!"
And they need something to do
Until I look at you
And then I condemn them
I know my kind
What goes on in our minds

[Outro: Dave Gahan, (Martin L. Gore), *audience*]
"Sing it!"
*It's just a question of time* "Woooh!"
*It's just a question of time*
It's just a question of time
It's just a question of time (It should be better)
It's just a question of time (It should be better with you)
It's just a question of time (It should be better)
It's just a question of time (It should be better with you) "Alright!
Come on, let me see those hands!"
(It should be better)
(It should be better with you)
*It's just a question of time*
"Thank you."
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
Words like violence break the silence
Come crashing in into my little world
Painful to me, pierce right through me
Can't you understand?
Oh, my little girl

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does the pain
Words are mеaningless and forgettable

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore, (audience), "Dave Gahan"]
(All I еver wanted)
(All I ever needed is) here in my arms
(Words are very unnecessary)
They can only do harm "Yeah, that's right!"
[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
"Alright!"
"Come on, let's hear you singing!"
[Chorus: Martin L. Gore (audience), "Dave Gahan"]
(All I ever wanted)
(All I ever needed) is here in my arms
(Words are very unnecessary)
They can only do harm
(All I ever wanted)
(All I ever needed) is here in my arms
(Words are very unnecessary)
They can only do harm
"Ah, that's right!"
[Interlude: Dave Gahan, (audience)]
"Martin!"
Move it!
Move it!
Move it!
Move it!
"Mmmmhm, he's got the moves!"
"Ooooh, yeah!"
"Ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, mister Martin L.!
(Gore)
"Gore!"
[Outro: Dave Gahan]
Enjoy the silence
"Thank you."
[Intro: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there
"Oooh, yeah..."

[Refrain: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
Reach out and touch faith

[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
Feeling unknown and you're all alone
Flesh and bone by the telephone
Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer
Take second best, put me to the test
Things on your chest you need to confess
I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver
"Alright!"
[Refrain: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

[Chorus: Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno]

Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith

Reach out and touch faith
"Thank you very much!"
[Verse 1: Martin L. Gore]
I'm not going down on my knees, begging you to adore me
Can't you see it's misery and torture for me?
When I'm misunderstood
Try as hard as you can, I've tried as hard as I could
To make you see
How important it is for me

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

[Post-Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
Understand me, understand me
Understand me, understand me

[Verse 2: Martin L. Gore]
Some people have to be permanently together
Lovers devoted to each other forever
Now I've got things to do
And I've said before that I know you have too
When I'm not there
In spirit, I'll be there

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
Here is a plea from my heart to you
And nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

[Post-Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
Understand me, understand me
Understand me, understand me

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
Here is a plea from my heart to you
Nobody knows me as well as you do
You know how hard it is for me to shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue in situations like these

[Outro: Martin L. Gore]
"Thank you!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
You wear guilt
Like shackles on your feet
Like a halo in reverse
I can feel
The discomfort in your seat
And in your head, it's worse

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
There's a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Can't you see?
All love's luxuries
Are here for you and me
"Yeah, that's right!"
[Chorus: Dave Gahan]
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms

[Chorus: Dave Gahan]
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

[Chorus: Dave Gahan]
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
And when our worlds they fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it

[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Thank you!"
[Intro: Dave Gahan]
"Come on, let's see those hands!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
When I'm with you baby
I go out of my head
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
All the things you do to me
And everything you said
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

[Chorus 1: Dave Gahan]
We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
We walk together
We're walking down the stree
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

[Chorus 2: Dave Gahan]
It's getting hotter, it's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
"Alright!"
"Alright."
"Come on now!
Let's hear you singing!"
[Bridge: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore, (audience)]
(I just can't get enough)

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

[Chorus 3: Dave Gahan]
You're like an angel and you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of

[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
"Alright!"
"Come on!"
"Sing it!"
"Come on, let's hear it!"
"Everybody!"
"Alright!
Alright, now."
"Come on, Berlin, let's hear it!"
[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"One more!"
"One more!"
"One more!"
"One more!"
"We thank you very much!"
Thank you!"
[Intro: Dave Gahan]
"Alright!"
"Alright!
Let's go!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
I feel you, your sun it shines
I feel you within my mind "Oh, yeah!"
You take me there, you take me where my kingdom comes
You take me to and lead me through Babylon

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno, "Dave Gahan"]
This is the morning of our love "Sing it!!"
It's just the dawning of our love

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
I feel you, your heart it sings "Yeaaah!"
I feel you, the joy it brings
Where heaven waits, those golden gates and back again
You take me to and lead me through oblivion

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore & Peter Gordeno, "Dave Gahan"]
This is the morning of our love "Sing it!"
It's just the dawning of our love

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan, (Martin L. Gore)]
I feel you, your precious soul
And I am whole "Aaaah!
Hey!"
I feel you, your rising sun (My kingdom comes)
My kingdom comes
"Oh, yeah.
That's right.
Oh, she comes!"
[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
"Woooh!"
[Verse 4: Dave Gahan]
I feel you, each move you make
I feel you, each breath you take
Where angels sing and spread their wings, my love's on high
You take me home, to glory's throne, by and by

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore, "Dave Gahan"]
This is the morning of our love "Sing it!"
It's just the dawning of our love "Come on!"
This is the morning of our love "Alright, come on!"
It's just the dawning of our love
"Play that guitar."
"Christian!"
[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Alright!
"Thank you!"
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where he's taking me
Taking me where I want to be
I'm taking a ride with my best friend

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore & Dave Gahan]
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I'm taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I'm as safe as houses
As long as I remember who's wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again "Oh, no..."
"Sing with me!"
[Chorus: Martin L. Gore, & Dave Gahan]
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground "No!"
We're flying high
We're watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground "Oooooooooooooooh!"
[Interlude: Dave Gahan]
"Alright!"
"Uh!"
"Alright!
Pick it up!"
"Wooooh!"
[Outro: Martin L. Gore, "Dave Gahan"]
See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's alright tonight
See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's alright tonight
See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's alright tonight
See the stars, they're shining bright
Everything's alright tonight
"Thank you very much!
Thank you!
See you next time, thank you!"
"Want one more song?
Just one more?
Come on boys."
"One more?"
"Alright, just for you, Berlin!
Thank you so much.
You have always been there for us.
And we thank you very much from bottoms of our hearts.
Thank you.
Come on.
Come over here.
No rest for the wicked."
[Verse 1: Dave Gahan]
It was you that took my soul
And threw it in the fire
And tamed it in the rapture
And filled me with desire

[Pre-Chorus 1: Dave Gahan]
Now I'm pure, now I'm clean
I feel good and serene
In you

[Verse 2: Dave Gahan]
There is no denying
How I have been changed
You won't hear me crying
Now misery is strange

[Pre-Chorus 2: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
I can dream, I can fly
Now it seems I get by
With you

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Goodbye again
Goodbye again

[Verse 3: Dave Gahan]
I was always looking, looking for someone
Someone to stick my hook in
And pull it out and run

[Pre-Chorus 3: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Now I'm caught on your ride
All my thoughts are entwined
In you

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Goodbye again
Goodbye again

[Verse 4: Dave Gahan]
If you see me walking
To the golden gates
Turn around, stop talking
Stop and hеsitate

[Pre-Chorus 4: Dave Gahan]
I'll be waiting up therе
With my fate in the air
For you

[Chorus: Dave Gahan & Martin L. Gore]
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye
Good-goodbye

[Outro: Dave Gahan]
"Thank you very much!"
"We'll see you next time!
Thank you!
Good night!"
[Verse 1: Martin L. Gore]
Condemnation, tried
Here on the stand with the book in my hand
And truth on my side
Accusations, lies
Hand me my sentence, I'll show no repentance
I'll suffer with pride

[Chorus 1: Martin L. Gore]
If for h onesty you want apologies
I don't sympathise
If for kindness you substitute blindness
Please open your eyes

[Verse 2: Martin L. Gore]
Condemnation, why?
Because my duty was always to beauty
And that was my crime
Feel elation, high
To know I can trust this fix of injustice
Time after time

[Chorus 2: Martin L. Gore]
If you see purity as immaturity
Well, it's no surprise
If for kindness you substitute blindnеss
Please open your еyes
[Verse 1: Martin L. Gore]
Is simplicity best
Or simply the easiest?
The narrowest path
Is always the holiest
So walk on barefoot for me
Suffer some misery

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
If you want my love
If you want my love

[Verse 2: Martin L. Gore]
Man will survive
The harshest conditions
And stay alive
Through difficult decisions
So make up your mind for me
Walk the line for me

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
If you want my love
If you want my love

[Bridge: Martin L. Gore]
Idle talk and hollow promises
Cheating Judases and doubting Thomases
Don't just stand there and shout it
Do something about it

[Verse 3: Martin L. Gore]
You can fulfill
Your wildest ambitions
And I'm sure you will
Lose your inhibitions
So open yourself for me
Risk your health for me

[Chorus: Martin L. Gore]
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
(If you want my love)
(If you want my love)
(If you want my love)
Put your arms around me child
Like when you bumped your shin
Then you'll know I love you now
As I loved you then

Though you maybe trying sometimes
And I'll need you
And you're not there
You know I may get mad
And turn away
But you know that I still care

But you cannot ask for more
Than can come from me
I am older than you are
And one day you'll see

If I lose my patience with you
And I suddenly start to scream
It's only because I just want you to be
Everything that I see in my dreams

And I'd like to know it's there
The feeling that we have
When you know that you can come
Running to me
Whenever times are bad

Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have

Though you are growing older now
And I'm watching you grow
I know I make you sad sometimes
And I see your feeling show

But one day I'll look around
And you will be grown
You'll be out in the world
Such a pretty girl
You'll be on your own

And I'd like to know it's there
The feeling that we have
Knowing that you can come to me
Whenever you are sad

And I'd like to know it's there
The feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have
Sweet thing
Let me tell you 'bout
The world and the way things are
You've come from a different place
And I know you've traveled far
Now that you've told me what it is
I'd better point you towards the Wiz

He's the Wiz
He's the man
He's the only one
Who can give your wish right to ya
He's the Wizard
He'll send you back through time
By running magic through ya
All of the super power's his
Listen and I'll tell you where he is

He's the Wiz and hе lives in Oz
He's the Wizard
Thеre's the way to Emerald City
That's not too far, is it?
He's the Wizard
Just take your dilemma, child
And lay it on the Wizard
He'll fix you a drink
That'll bubble and foam
And in a flash
You will be home

He's the Wiz
He's the Wiz
He's the Wizard of Oz
He's got magic up his sleeve
He's the Wizard
And you know without his help
It would be impossible to leave
Fantastic powers at his command
And I'm sure that he will understand

He's the Wiz and he lives in Oz

Sweet thing
Let me tell you 'bout
The world and the way things are
I'm gonna point you towards the Wiz

He's the Wiz
Fantastic powers at his command
And I'm sure that he will understand

He's the Wiz and he lives in Oz

Sweet thing
Let me tell you 'bout
The world and the way things are
You've come from a different place
And I know you've traveled far
Now that you've told me what it is
I'd better point you towards the Wiz

He's the Wiz!
There's a feeling here inside
That I cannot hide
And I know I've tried
But it's turning me around

I'm not sure that I'm aware
If I'm up or down
Or here or there
I need both feet on the ground

Maybe I'm just going crazy
Let myself get uptight
I'm acting just like a baby
But I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be alright

Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home

In a different place
In a different time
Different people around me
I would like to know of that different world
And how different they find me

And just what's a Wiz
Is he big, will he scare me?
If I ask to leave
Will the Wiz even hear me?
How will I know then
If I'll ever get home again?
Here I am alone
Though it feels the same
I don't know where I'm going
I'm here on my own
And it's not a game
And a strange wind is blowing

I'm so amazed
At the things that I see here
Don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be afraid
I just don't want to be here
In my mind this is clear
What am I doing here?
I wish I was home

I wish
I wish
I wish
You can't win
You can’t break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep sayin'
Things are gonna change
But they look just like they’re staying the same
You get in
Way over your head
And you've only got yourself to blame

You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win
The world keeps movin'
And you're standin’ far behind
People keep sayin’
Things 'll get better
Just to ease your state of mind
So you lay back
And you smoke that smoke
And you drink your glass of wine

You can’t win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win
You can’t win
No way if your story stays the same
You ain't winnin'
But it's nice to see you
I'm awfully glad you came
Better cool it
'Cause it ain't about losin'
Then the world has got no shame

You can't win, chile
You can't break even
And you can't get out of the game

You can't win
You can't win
You can't break even
Ain't the way
It's supposed to be
You'll be spendin'
Your little bit of money
While someone else ride free
Learn your lesson, refuel your mind
Before some turkey blows out your flame

Slide some oil to me
Let it trickle down my spine
If you don't have STP
Crisco will do just fine

Slide some to my elbows
And to my fingers if you would
Slide some oil to me, girl
Whoo!
Don't that feel good!
Slide some oil to my feet, look
I got toes again
Come on and slide some oil to my knees
And let me see if I can bend

Slide some oil to me
I'm beginning to feel just fine
Slide some oil down my throat
And let me lubricate my mind

Slide some oil to me
Go ahead, hit my shoulder blades
Those who don't have to lubricate
Sure got it made
Slide some oil to me
Let it slip down my side
Laying there in one position
Sure does make me tired

Now watch me dance!
And let me lubricate my mind

Say what you wanna
But I'm here to stay
'Cause I'm a mean ole lion
You can go where you're gonna
But don't get in my way
I'm a mean ole lion

You'll be standing in a draft
If you don't hear me laugh
And if you happen to come around
Well, you best not make me frown
For I just might knock you down
I'm a mean ole lion

You know I'm ready to fight
And turn your day into night
'Cause I'm a mean ole lion
If you're half bright
You'll detour to the right
From a mean ole lion

All you strangers better beware
This is the king of the jungle here
And if I happen to let you slide
Don't just stand here
Run and hide
You just caught my better side

I'm a mean ole lion

Look
You better beware
This is the king of the jungle here
And if I happen to let you slide
Don't stand here
Run and hide
You just caught my better side

I'm a mean ole lion
I'm a mean ole lion
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on and ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road

Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down, down the road

Pick your left foot up
When your right foot's down
Come on legs keep movin'
Don't you lose no ground
You just keep on keepin'
On the road that you choose
Don't you give up walkin'
'Cause you gave up shoes, no

Ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road

'Cause there maybe times
When you think you lost your mind
And the steps you're takin'
Leave you three, four steps behind
But the road you're walking
Might be long sometimes
You just keep on steppin'
And you'll be just fine, yeah

Ease on down, ease on down the road
Come on, ease on down, ease on down the road
Don't you carry nothing that might be a load
Come on, ease on down, ease on down the

Oh, there maybe times
When you wish you wasn't born
And you wake one morning
Just to find that your courage's gone
But just know that feeling
Only last a little while
You just stick with us
And we'll show you how to smile, yeah

Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, get 'em up, ease on down the road

Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, goin' down, ease on down
Get 'em up, get 'em up, ease on down the road
There is a place we'll go
Where there is mostly quiet
Flowers and butterflies
A rainbow lives beside it

And from a velvet sky
A summer storm
You can feel the coolness in the air
But you're still warm

And then a mighty roar
Will start the sky to cryin'
But not even light'ning
Will be frightening my lion

And with no fear inside
No need to run
No need to hide
You're standing strong and tall
You're the bravest of them all

If on courage you must call
Then just keep on tryin'
And tryin', and tryin'
You're a lion
In your own way, be a lion

Come on be a lion

I am standing strong and tall
You'rе the bravest of them all
If on couragе you must call
Keep on tryin'
And tryin', and tryin'
I'm a lion
In my own way
I'm a lion
A lion
A lion
A lion
So you wanted to meet the wizard
Let me tell you that you've come to the right place
Shall I make you a frog or a lizard
You should see the strange expression on your face

If the way I come on is frightening
That's the way I felt like coming on today
Have you ever been kissed by lightning?
Let me tell you that will make you go away!
I fly, and the magic of my power takes me higher
To a level where the clouds turn into fire
In the warmness of the fire
I feel fine

Just keep your eyes open and the magic you will see
It will whistle on the wind
As it emanates from me
It's a strong and true vibration
You can feel it on your skin

Now come and take my hand
And we will dance
Upon the wind
So you wanted to meet the wizard!
Feeling?
Feeling?
Swear to God this is more than I can deal with
Thinkin' back on that old song
Where did I go wrong by caring and sharing
Mean together no matter
I can't stand not knowing
Is this what feeling gets
A hope for happy endings?
Alone and scared
Something I don't want to be
What did he see when he looked inside of me?
If this is just a dream
How come I feel like screaming?
This is the real world
Gotta do what you must, girl

Well
Can I?
Can I?
Is this what feeling gets?
So is there a happy ending?
There's nothing here but the fear of
Will I try?
And can I stare it in the eye
Not ever knowing why?
Please
Please
Can someone tell me why?
When I wake up in the afternoon
Which it pleases me to do
Don't nobody bring me no bad news
'Cause I wake up already negative
And I've wired up my fuse
So don't nobody bring me no bad news

If we're going to be buddies
Better bone up on the rules
'Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
You can be my best of friends
As opposed to payin' dues
But don't nobody bring me no bad news

No bad news
No bad news
Don't you ever bring mе no bad news
'Cause I'll make you an offеr, child
That you cannot refuse
So don't nobody bring me no bad news

When you're talking to me
Don't be cryin' the blues
'Cause don't nobody bring me no bad news
You can verbalize and vocalize
But just bring me the clues
But don't nobody bring me no bad news

Bring some message in your head
Or in something you can't lose
But don't you ever bring me no bad news
If you're gonna bring me something
Bring me, something I can use
But don't you bring me no bad news
Everybody look around
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice you see
Everybody come out
And let's commence to singing joyfully
Everybody look up
And feel the hope that we've been waiting for

Everybody's glad
Because our silent fear and dread is gone
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up
Into the morning into happiness

Hello world
It's like a different way of living now
And thank you world
We always knew that we'd be free somehow
In harmony
And show the world that we've got liberty

It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up
Into the morning into happiness
Hello world
It's like a different way of living now
And thank you world
We always knew that we'd be free somehow
In harmony
And show the world that we've got liberty

It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see, has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
Can't you feel a brand new day?
If you believe
Within your heart you'll know
That no one can change
The path that you must go

Believe what you feel
And know you're right, because
The time will come around
When you say it's yours

Believe there's a reason to be
Believe you can make time stand still
You know from the moment you try
If you believe
I know you will

Believe in yourself, right from the start
You'll have brains
You'll have a heart
You'll havе courage
To last your whole life through

If you bеlieve in yourself
If you believe in yourself
If you believe in yourself
As I believe in you
When I think of home, I think of a place
Where there's love overflowing
I wish I was home, I wish I was back there
With the things I been knowing

Wind that makes the tall grass bend into leaning
Suddenly the raindrops that fall have a meaning
Sprinklin' the scene, makes it all clean

Maybe there's a chance for me to go back there
Now that I have some direction
It would sure be nice to be back home
Where there's love and affection

And just maybe I can convince time to slow up
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up
Time be my friend, let me start again

Suddenly my world has changed it's face
But I still know where I'm going
I have had my mind spun around in space
And yet I've watched it growing

If you're listening God
Please don't make it hard to know
For us to believe in the things that we see

Tell us should we run away
Or should we try and stay?
Or would it be better just to let things be?
Living here, in this brand new world
Might be a fantasy
But it taught me to love
So it's real, real to me

And I've learned
That we must look inside our hearts
To find a world full of love
Like yours, like mine, like home
[Verse 1]
I woke up Sunday morning
Another twenty years gone by
Pulled myself out of my bed
It's getting harder every time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Grab my phone, but there's no messages at all
Then I realize there's no one left to call

[Chorus]
Whoa - Seems like things ain't what they used to be
Whoa - Can't cry anymore
I'm alone
Whoa - Where did everyone go?
[Verse 2]
I drive to work every morning
And no one looks me in the eye
It feels like love has left the world
And I can't help but wonder why

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I had that dream again where I begin to fall
And on the way down, learn the meaning of it all

[Chorus]
Whoa - No, things ain't what they used to be
Whoa - Can't cry anymore
I'm alone
Whoa - Where did everyone go?
[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I fell asleep last night and woke up in the fall
Turned my head and blinked and now there stands a wall

[Chorus]
Whoa - Seems like things ain't what they used to be
Whoa - I can't cry anymore
I'm alone
Whoa - Where did everyone go?
Whoa
Whoa - Where did everyone go?
Who'll tell the tale when words collide?
Where is intelligent design?
I live in fear and destitution
There's someone else in my reflection I don't recognize

I found the dream but I was blind
Now I'm looking for a second chance before I lose my mind
Climb the devil's tower one more time

And like a shot time rushes by
How many summers till I die?
Now I'm a man of resolution
No longer making all the same mistakes anymore

I found the dream but I was blind
Now I'm looking for a second chance before I lose my mind
Climb the devil's tower one more time
Now I'm looking for a second chance before I lose my mind

Now I'm a man of resolution
No longer making all the same mistakes anymore

I found the dream but I was blind
Now I'm looking for a second chance before I lose my mind
Climb the devil's tower one more time
Now I'm looking for a second chance before I lose my mind
I found the dream but I was blind
Climb the devil's tower one more time
Almost forgot, it's easy to fall into her eyes
She seems to fall in love with everyone who passes by
Although she says she cares when she does it doesn't show
Frozen smile she gave this time

She can yes or she can say no

It's a fearful heart
That would let go

Finally free so many years and separate lives
It could be our time make up your mind
I'm right in front of you
Although you say you care if you do it doesn't show
You throw a smile and wave goodbye

She can yes or she can say no
Wanna pull her close just to let know
A fearful heart but she turns away
When I just don't know what she's trying to say

She can yes or she can say no
It's a fearful heart that would let go

Oh, I know that you know that I wanted you
How many wage gonna tell you

Yeah, you're giving me signs that I don't understand
But maybe I've got this so wrong
Goodbye...

She can yes or she can say no
Wanna I pull her close just to let know
It's a fearful heart but she turns away
And I just don't know what just trying today

She can yes or she can say no
It's a fearful heart that would let it go
It's fearful heart but she turns away
I wanna pull her close, wanna pull her close
She can yes or she can say no
[Verse 1]
Hold tight my love I’m stealing you away
There you were across the room
You were speaking without words you had so much to say
It feels good, feels right
Let’s do this our own way
Now it’s just the two of us
We’ve got nothing to lose and no one’s in our way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
If they could see the way you smile at me
How could I ever let you go

[Chorus]
Whoa oo oh
Your gypsy heart will set you free
Whoa oo oh
Let’s dance upon the Spanish sea
Yeah ee yeah
Close your eyes and come with me
Whoa oo oh, aww

[Verse 2]
Let’s savor tonight and feel the golden flames
Tell me where the harm is done
Let’s throw away the rules and wash our sins away
Let’s run through the fire like children at play
We’re not children anymore
We only got one life so let’s live it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
If they could see the way you smiled at me
How could I ever let you go

[Chorus 2]
Whoa oo oh
Your gypsy heart will set you free
Whoa oo oh
Let’s dance upon the Spanish sea
Yeah ee yeah
Darlin' close your eyes and come with me
Whoa oo oh

[instrumental solos]

[ Pre-Chorus 3]
Wish you could see the way she smiles at me
How could I ever let you go

[Chorus 3]
Whoa oo oh
Your gypsy heart will set you free
Whoa oo oh
Let’s dance upon the Spanish sea
Yeah ee yeah
Close your eyes and come with me
Whoa oo oh

[Chorus 4]
Close your eyes and come with me
Whoa oo oh
Your gypsy heart will set you free
Whoa oo oh
Dance upon the Spanish sea
Yeah ee yeah
Darlin' close your eyes and come with me
Whoa oo oh
Let’s dance upon the Spanish sea
Whoa oo oh
In a little while
We can both be together
In a little while
We could be all alone

For a little while
While I hold on and hold out
Will you be there
In this city when I'm coming home

In a little while
When the wind change direction
If I had a wish
It's having you in my arms

For a little while
If you hold on and hold out
I will be there
To keep you safe from harm

In a little while
We could make love forever
In a little while
Till our hearts beat together
Throw away your gasp
Till the full moon is over
Yes, I, I'll be there in a little while

With you right there beside me
Loneliness will be something I've never known
For a little while
If I hold on and hold out
Will you be there
In this city when I'm coming home

In a little while
We could make love forever
In a little while
Till our hearts beat together
Throw away your gasp
Till the full moon is over
Yes, I'll be there in a little while

All the people in the other room
Couldn't feel the love that last
Long fate has tapped me - another chance
For how long that it is - not the longer it was
Soon this is thrill, you know I need you

For a little while
Yes, I hold on and hold out
Will you be there
In this city where I'm going home
Will you be there
In this city where I'm going home
I will be there

In a little while, in a little while
Should be sleeping, sleeping
Just a little while - hold on and hold out
Till I'm creeping old

In a little while, in a little while
In a little while, in a little while
Should be sleeping
Hold on and hold out
Just a little while
There she goes down the Hollywood road
Facing the sun, she begins to cry
The end of a perfect night
Loves her new bleeding dagger tattoo
She pulls off her coat and she waves her arms
Dying to see the stars

On and on and on she goes
With a passion in her heart
On and on and on and on
Till she dies

Chelsea's coming to meet
Remember the beat
That night two star-crossed lovers agree
Just wasn't to be
Was only a dream
Will Shakespeare's rolling his eyes

A broken man acting like a clown
Conjuring ghosts to relive her lie
Wandering through the night
Where he goes, no one really knows
Mumbling something about a plan
He's onto his own demise

On and on and on he goes
With a murder on his mind
On and on and on and on
Till he dies

Chelsea's coming to meet
Remember the beat
That great disaster down the street
It wasn't a treat
To be all the same
Will Shakespeare's rolling his eyes

Chelsea, I never meant to do you no harm
And Chelsea, I'll never leave you
I belong to your heart

Chelsea's coming to meet
Remember the beat
That night two star-crossed lovers agree
Just wasn't to be

Can't hide the debris
That great disaster down the street
Let everyone see
American grief

That Chelsea does still call unto me
Remember to be
To be all the same
Will Shakespeare's rolling his eyes
So just don't worry, we can chase the rain (the rain)
And fall (in love) in love
For good baby (so just don't worry baby)
So just don't worry mama
So just don't worry, you can take the pain (the pain)
It's all about (allowed)
(So just don't worry baby) thrill babe
So just don't worry mama

She's holding on
By a threat mostly recalled
So afraid of letting go
You can choose to live in fear
And believe that better days are gone
Or remember it's a world that treats you fine
You can change your mind

So just don't worry, we can chase the rain (the rain)
And fall (in love) in love
For good baby (so just don't worry baby)
So just don't worry mama
So just don't worry, you can take the pain (the pain)
It's all about (allowed)
(So just don't worry baby) thrill babe
So just don't worry mama

She's holding back
Still afraid to take a chance
It's our to watch unity suffering
I wacked my tears and asked myself
Is this something that I could have done
To show her that there's always love to find

Clouds in the sky
Break away from you and me
You should know well everyone inside dreams
I will be finding you

So just don't worry, we can chase the rain (the rain)
And fall (in love) in love
For good baby (so just don't worry baby)
So just don't worry mama
So just don't worry, you can take the pain (the pain)
It's all (allowed)
About thrill babe (so just don't worry baby)
So just don't worry mama

So just don't worry, we can chase the rain (the rain)
And fall (in love) in love
For good baby (so just don't worry mama)
You can take the pain (the pain)
It's all (allowed)
About thrill babe (so just don't worry mama)
You never told me you were going away
Oh why?
Oh why?
You'll never hear the words I meant to say
Oh why?
You never should have acted like you care
You could have turned around and walk the other way

I never wanna hear you say goodbye to me
I never wanna hear you say goodbye
I never wanna hear you say goodbye, goodbye

You pull the heart by out of me
Oh why?
Oh why?
My eyes were blind and you made me see
Oh why?
A love life guards to fall apart
Why did I take so long to catch on from the start?
I never wanna to hear you say goodbye to me
I never wanna to hear you say goodbye
Never wanna say goodbye
I never want to hear you say goodbye, goodbye

You never should have acted like you care
You could have turned around and walk the other way

I never wanna hear you say goodbye to me
I never wanna to hear you say goodbye
Never gonna say goodbye
I never want to hear you say goodbye to me
I never want to hear you say goodbye
(You say goodbye) I never want to hear you say goodbye to me
(Never told me why) I never want to hear you say goodbye
(Never got to tell you why) I never want to hear you say goodbye, goodbye
[Verse 1]
You can drown in your sorrows, you can float out to sea
Where the maelstrom is hollerin', for a moment you’re free
Oh, vagabond warrior, you’re a long way from home
Where the eagles are soaring, and kings are enthroned

[Chorus]
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
I've been struck by lightning

[Verse 2]
You’ve been spared from the gallows, but it’s still not the end
You got the rest of your life to make your amends
It’s harbor you’re seeking, and shelter from harm
Don’t leave me here stranded, better sound the alarm

[Chorus]
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
I've been struck by lightning

[Bridge]
The heavens opened up, and an angel spoke:
"You can’t go home, they’ll just keep throwing stones."
"You’re better off on more enlightened shores."
"You stick around and you’ll get nothing..."

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
Can you save me?
[Outro (chanting)]
Struck in the back by lightning, struck in the back by lightning!
(x2)
Tonight's the night we leave this all behind
Stuck in the same old place, in the same old state of mind
Before our luck runs out, let's get out while we can
We're turning in circles, we're back where we began

Tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running on next to nothing
Tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running on next to nothing

Tonight's the night we leave this all behind
Stuck in the same old place, in the same old state of mind
Before our luck runs out, let's get out while we can
We're turning in circles, we're back where we began

Don't leave me hanging tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running on next to nothing
Tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running on next to nothing, whoa

Tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running on next to nothing
We keep on running, we keep on running
Tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running, we keep on running
We keep on running on next to nothing
Tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running on next to nothing
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, whoo
We keep on running on next to nothing

We keep on running on next to nothing
We keep on running on next to nothing
