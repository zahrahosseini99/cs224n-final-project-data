*Baby Crying*

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Momma loves her baby
And Daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, babe
And the sky may look blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe
Ooh-ooh-ooh, baby blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, babe

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you, the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You'll slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice
[Verse: Roger Waters]
Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snapshot in the family album
Daddy, what else did you leave for me?
Daddy, what'd ya leave behind for me?
All in all, it was just a brick in the wall
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Hey!
*Children playing*
[Intro: Roger Waters]
You!
Yes, you!
Stand still, laddie!
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who
Would hurt the children in any way they could (Oof!)
By pouring their derision upon anything we did
Exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kid

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
But in the town, it was well known, when they got home at night
Their fat and psychopathic wives would thrash them within inches of their lives
[Intro]

[Verse: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teacher, leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher!
Leave them kids alone!
[Chorus: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
All in all, it's just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse: Islington Green School Students]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers, leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher!
Leave us kids alone!
[Chorus: Islington Green School Students]
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall
All in all, you're just another brick in the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Wrong, do it again!
(*Children playing*)
Wrong, do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
(Wrong, do it again!)
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
(Wrong, do it again!)
You!
Yes!
You behind the bike sheds!
Stand still, laddie!
(If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?)
(You!
Yes!
You behind the bike sheds!
Stand still, laddie!)
*Children playing*
*Phone beeping sound*
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb?
Mother, do you think they'll like this song?
Mother, do you think they'll try to break my balls?
Ooh-ah, Mother, should I build the wall?
[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Mother, should I run for president?
Mother, should I trust the government?
Mother, will they put me in the firing line?
Ooh-ah, is it just a waste of time?
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mamma's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mamma's gonna keep you right here, under her wing
She won't let you fly, but she might let you sing
Mamma's gonna keep baby cosy and warm

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
Of course, Mamma's gonna help build the wall

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Mother, do you think she's good enough... For me?
Mother, do you think she's dangerous... To me?
Mother, will she tear your little boy apart?
Ooh-ah, Mother, will she break my heart?
[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Hush now, baby, baby, don't you cry
Mamma's gonna check out all your girlfriends for you
Mamma won't let anyone dirty get through
Mamma's gonna wait up until you get in
Mamma will always find out where you've been
Mamma's gonna keep baby healthy and clean

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh babe, ooh babe, ooh babe
You'll always be "baby" to me

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Mother, did it need to be so high?
[Spoken Intro: Harry Waters]
Look, Mummy!
There's an airplane up in the sky

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
Did-did-did-did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath the clear blue sky?
[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Did-did-did-did you see the frightened ones?
Did-did-did-did you hear the falling bombs?
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

[Outro: David Gilmour]
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye, blue sky
Goodbye
Goodbye
[Intro]

[Verse: Roger Waters]
What shall we use to fill the empty spaces
Where we used to talk?
How shall I fill the final places?
How should I complete the wall?
[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
(Ah) I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times?
Who's gonna show this stranger around?
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Will some woman in this desert land
Make me feel like a real man?
Take this rock-and-roll refugee
Ooh, baby, set me free

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Ooh, I need a dirty woman
Ooh, I need a dirty girl

[Outro]
*Phone beeping*
"Hello?"
"Yes, a collect call for Mrs. Floyd from Mr. Floyd.
Will you accept the charge from the United States?"
*Phone clicks*
"Oh, he hung up.
That's your residence, right?
Well, I wonder why he hung up.
Is there supposed to be someone out there besides your wife there to answer?"
*Phone redials and beeps again*
"Hello?"
"This is the United States calling.
Are we reaching..."
*Phone clicks*
"See, he keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering."
[Intro]
"Oh my God!
What a fabulous room!
Are all these your guitars?"
("I'm sorry sir, I didn't mean to startle you")
"God!
This place is bigger than our apartment!"
("Let me know when you're entering a room")
("Yes, sir")
"Um, can I get a drink of water?"
("I was wondering about")
"You want some, huh?"
("Yes")
"Oh wow!
Hey, look at this tub!
Wanna take a bath?"
("I'll have to find out from Mrs. Bancroft what time she wants to meet us, for her main")
"What are you watching?"
("If you'll just let me know as soon as you can, Mrs. Bancroft... Mrs. Bancroft")
"Hello?"
("I don't understand")
"Are you feeling okay?"
[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Day after day, the love turns gray
Like the skin of the dying man
And night after night, we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older, and you have grown colder
And nothing is very much fun any more
And I can feel one of my turns coming on
I feel cold as a razor blade, tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened, this is just a passing phase
One of my bad days
Would you like to watch TV?
Or get between the sheets?
Or contemplate the silent freeway?
Would you like something to eat?
Would you like to learn to fly?
Would ya?
Would you like to see me try?
Ah, no!
[Outro: Roger Waters]
Would you like to call the cops?
Do you think it's time I stopped?
Why are you running away?
[Hook: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder in front of my friends

[Hook: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
(Need you, need you, need you, need you, need you, need you)
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

[Hook: Roger Waters]
Oh, babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooh, babe, why are you running away?
[Outro: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
Argh!
[Intro]
*Sounds from TV*

[Verse: Roger Waters]
I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all

[Chorus: Roger Waters]
All in all, it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all, you were all just bricks in the wall
[Verse: Roger Waters]
Goodbye, cruel world, I'm leaving you today
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, all you people, there's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind, goodbye
[Acoustic Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there in the cold, getting lonely, getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you
Don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight

[Verse 2: David Gilmour]
Hey you
Out there on your own, sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you
With your ear against the wall, waiting for someone to call out
Could you touch me?
Hey you
Would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain

[Breakdown]

[Verse 3: Roger Waters]
Hey you
Out there on the road, always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you
Out there beyond the wall, breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you
Don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
(We fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall, we fall...)
[Intro]
"Well, only got an hour of daylight left.
Better get started"
"Isn't it unsafe to travel at night?"
"It'll be a lot less safe to stay here.
Your father's gonna pick up our trail before long"
"Can Lorca ride?"
"He'll have to ride.
Lorca, time to go!
Chengra, thank you for everything.
Let's go."
"Goodbye, Chengra"
"Goodbye, Missy!"
"I'll be back--one day"

[Refrain: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anybody out there?
Ah, is there anybody out there?
[Instrumental Outro]
[Intro]
"But there's somebody else that needs taking care of in Washington..."
"Who's that?"
"Rose Pilchitt!"
"Rose Pilchitt?
Who's that?"
*Kid screams in background*
(Shut up!)
"36-24-36 *Laughs* does that answer your question?"
(Oi!
I've got a little black book with me poems in!)
"Who's she?"
"She was 'Miss Armoured Division' in 1961... "

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with a toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got thirteen channels of shit on the T.V.
to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation

[Chorus 1: Roger Waters]
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There will be nobody home

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
I've got the obligatory Hendrix perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
I've got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to (Fly to... fly to... fly to...)

[Chorus 2: Roger Waters]
Ooh, babe, when I pick up the phone
("Surprise, surprise, surprise...")
There's still nobody home

[Outro: Roger Waters]
I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots
[Intro]
"Where the hell are you?
"Where the hell are you, Simon?"
*Shots*

[Verse: Roger Waters]
Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn?
Remember how she said that
We would meet again some sunny day?
Vera, Vera, what has become of you?
Does anybody else in here feel the way I do?
[Verse: Roger Waters]
Bring the boys back home
Bring the boys back home
Don't leave the children on their own, no, no
Bring the boys back home

[Outro]
"Wrong, do it again!"
*Knock* "Time to go!"
"Are you feeling okay?"
"He keeps hanging up, and it's a man answering!"
"Hahahahaha!!!!!!"
Is there anybody out there?
[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Hello?
(Hello, hello, hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on (Come on, come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax (Relax, relax, relax)
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?
[Pre-Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
Okay (Okay, okay, okay)
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
(Stand up, stand up)
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo 2]
[Intro: David Gilmour]
(Ah-ah) Ooh, ooh-hoo, ooh, ooh
(Ah-ah)
(Ah-ah)
(Ooh-ma, ah, ooh-pa) Must the show go on?
(Ooh-pa, take me home, take me home, take me home)
(Ooh-ma, let me go, let me go, let me go)

[Verse: David Gilmour]
There must be some mistake, I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul, am I too old, is it too late?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Where has the feeling gone?
(Ooh-ma, ooh-pa) Will I remember the song?
[Outro: David Gilmour]
(Ooh, ooh, ah) The show must go on
[Intro]
"Three, two...
fire!"
[Verse 1]
So ya thought ya might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion, that space cadet glow
I've got some bad news for you sunshine
Pink isn't well, he stayed back at the hotel
And they sent us along as a surrogate band
We're gonna find out where you fans really stand

[Verse 2]
Are there any queers in the theater tonight?
Get them up against the wall
(Against the wall)
Now there's one in the spotlight, he don't look right to me
Get him up against the wall
(Against the—)
And that one looks Jewish and that one's a coon!
Who let all of this riff-raff into the room?
There's one smoking a joint and another with spots
If I had my way, I'd have all of them shot!
[Instrumental Outro]
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
You better make your face up with your favourite disguise
With your button down lips and your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile and your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters as the cockleshell shatters
And the hammers batter down your door
You better run!
[Chorus: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run, run, run, run

[Verse 2: Roger Waters]
You better run all day and run all night
And keep your dirty feelings deep inside
And if you're taking your girlfriend out tonight
You better park the car well out of sight
'Cause if they catch you in the back seat trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to Mother in a cardboard box
You better run!
[Synth Solo]

[Instrumental Outro]
[Intro]
"Eins, zwei, drei, alle!"
Ooh-ooh, you cannot reach me now
Ooh-ooh, no matter how you try
Goodbye, cruel world, it's over
Walk on by

[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come (Worms to come)
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Testing.
One.
Two.
One.
Two.
We’re all going to convene at 1:15 outside Brixton Town Hall where we will be going...

[Hook: Roger Waters]
(Waiting) To cut out the deadwood
(Waiting) To clean up the city
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To put on a black shirt
(Waiting) To weed out the weaklings
(Waiting) To smash in their windows and kick in their doors
(Waiting) For the final solution to strengthen the strain
(Waiting) To follow the worms
(Waiting) To turn on the showers and fire the ovens
(Waiting) For the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews
(Waiting) To follow the worms

[Verse 2: David Gilmour & Roger Waters]
Would you like to see Britannia Rule again
My friend?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins home again
My friend?
All you need to do is follow the worms

[Outro]
Stop!
[Verse: Roger Waters]
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform and leave the show
But I'm waiting in this cell, because I have to know
(Have to know, have to know...)
Have I been guilty all this time?
(Have to know, have to know, have to know, have to know...)
(Time, time, time, time...)
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1: Prosecutor]
Good morning, Worm your honour
The crown will plainly show the prisoner
Who now stands before you
Was caught red-handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do
Call the schoolmaster!
[Verse 2: The Schoolmaster]
I always said he'd come to no good in the end your honour
If they'd let me have my way I could have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied, the bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder, let me hammer him today

[Chorus 1: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy, toys in the attic
I am crazy, truly gone fishing
They must have taken my marbles away!
(Crazy, toys in the attic, he is crazy)

[Verse 3: Wife]
You little shit, you're in it now, I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often than you did, but no!
You had to go your own way
Have you broken any homes up lately?
"Just five minutes, Worm your honour, him and me, alone"

[Verse 4: Mother]
Babe!
Come to mother baby, let me hold you in my arms
M'lud I never wanted him to get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me?
Worm, your honour, let me take him home

[Chrous 2: Pink (and Choir)]
Crazy, over the rainbow
I am crazy, bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
(Crazy, over the rainbow, he is crazy)

[Verse 5: The Judge]
The evidence before the court is incontrovertible
There's no need for the jury to retire
In all my years of judging, I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving of the full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer, your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
(Go on, Judge, shit on him!)
Since, my friend, you have revealed your deepest fear
I sentence you to be exposed before your peers
Tear down the wall!
[Outro: Crowd]
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
Tear down the wall!
*explosion*
*bricks crumbling*
[Verse]
All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down, outside the wall
Some hand in hand
And some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall, after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad bugger's wall

[Outro]
Isn't this where...
Isn't this where…
…we came in?
[Verse 1]
I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
But I was never told about the sorrows

[Chorus]
And, how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

[Verse 2]
I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
We could never see tomorrow
No one said a word about the sorrow

[Chorus]
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
And how can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again

[Bridge]
La la la la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la, la la la la

[Outro]
Please help me mend my broken heart and let me live again
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da da, da
[Verse 1]
You've had your troubles Israel
I've seen them all
But you put the writing on the wall
Israel, Israel

[Verse 2]
You know I've seen you fall so many times
I've cried for you and that's a crime
Israel, Israel, Israel

[Chorus]
Where there's sand
Where there's beautiful sand
You know you got a kind of feeling
That's just grand
Take me into your arms
Let me be with you
Israel, Israel, Israel

[Verse 3]
I like the smiles up on your people's faces
They make you feel warm embraces
And I want that kind of smile
That kind of smile
Israel you make the whole world think about you
And if they don't they'll find a reason
To shout about Israel, Israel

[Verse 4]
You're the only one, Israel, Israel
Tell me all about it!
Tell me all about it
Tell me all about it
Oh, take me into your arms
And make me feel your goodness
Be with me Israel
Take me into your arms
Let me hold hold you to myself
Oh, I want to, Israel

[Outro]
Israel, take me back into into your arms
Israel, Israel, Israel, Israel
Israel
Before I heard your voice
I never heard a sound like that before
I wanna hear it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fall
So I can hear you call, your love

I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
I'd be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl

Before I saw your face
I never saw a dream like that before
I wanna see it more and more

Take me to heaven
My love is stronger than the wall
I'll climb it till I fall
So I can hear you call, your love

Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I've got the greatest girl
Be the greatest man in the world
'Cause I can say I got the greatest girl
The greatest girl

Be the greatest man in the world
Oh, be the greatest man in the world
Be the greatest man, the greatest man in the world
The greatest man, be the greatest man in the world
Just the way that I feel about tomorrow
I'll be sad and alone all the time
It's just the way that you said
You don't love me anymore, then goodbye

I can't believe what you're saying
You don't love me anymore, goodbye

Just the way that I feel about tomorrow
Knowing you won't be there by my side
I wish that I could say to you
Well, can't we just be good friends?
Would you leave the door open
Let me walk in again?
That's the way I've been thinking 'bout tomorrow
I only know that friends can't be lovers again
I never really want to be alone
I had a woman once in my life
But now she's flown
Every night I keep seeing her face

I never really broke her heart
She was a part of me
But that's the way it was
Now we live separately
When will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces but now I feel as good as if I were dead

I'll keep remembering all my life
Remembering when you were my wife
Remembering all my life
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering

I first set my eyes on you one cold February
You made me go out of my way to make me feel fine
Oh, but when will you walk through this door babe?
When you left I fell to pieces, now I feel as good, as good as if I were dead

I'll keep remembering all my life
Remembering when you were my wife
Remembering all my life
And I'm facing a life that I must go through remembering
I arise, try to see my face through my disguise
And on the balcony I knew inside of me it will be done
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon

I arose, the truth will out the more it grows
It's not a mystery, no one was hiding it from me
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon
Somebody stop the music, somebody stop the tune
Somebody crown the clown with the red balloon

Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya
Don't love ya, baby don't love ya

Yeah, today I saw the sun, the sun
I rolled into the smoke and there I lost my hope
I need someone to know me and to show me
The square peg fits the hole
Why haven't I been told?
I need someone to know me and to show me
Trafalgar, trafalgar, trafalgar, please don't let me down

Ten hundred people roam through the place I call me home

I need someone to know me and to show me
Sitting cross-legged on my own and yet I'm not alone
Don't need no one to show me
No one owns me
Trafalgar, trafalgar, trafalgar
Trafalgar, trafalgar, trafalgar, please don't let me down

Trafalgar
[Verse 1]
I am the searcher of my fortunes
I've got my right hand on the wheel
We've got to dig the buried treasures
I know, exactly how I feel

[Chorus]
Don't want to live inside myself
I'm much better off alone
But then you must believe
In the falling rain

[Refrain]
Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself
Don't wanna live inside myself

[Verse 2]
I went walking through a graveyard
Where the darkness is my friend
I heard all about the beginning
I wanna see just where it ends

[Chorus]

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
I have fed the jaded tiger
And every tiger knows my name
But just as long, as long as I can see my face
I can tell myself my name

[Chorus]

[Refrain / Coda] repeat x3
[Verse 1]
Tell me if dreams do come true
If so, then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you, I won't forgive

[Chorus]
When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in

[Verse 2]
Tell me if dreams do come true
If so then I know that I'm losing you
And you know the address where we live
But I swear there'll be no turning back to you
I won't forgive

[Chorus]
When do I and when do I
Know if there's an answer why?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
How do I and how do I
Stop myself from gonna cry?
I wonder if I know where I fit in
And when do I and when do I
When do I
When do I know if I fit in?
I hear you calling me dearest too
My dearest, I'm nearest, then I've ever been before
To have you calling me dearest once more

My dearest, this picture
My own memory
Wishing this picture was reality

Where do I go from here?
The Lord took you away
And if you could see my today, I will remember you
I will remember you

My dearest, sincerest
There's no one but you and
Here in my heart you're my dearest too

Where do I go from here?
The Lord took you away
And if you could see me today, I will remember you
I will remember you

My dearest, sincerest
There's no one but you and
Here in my heart you're my dearest too
Lion in my winter
I'm a lion with no crown

You wanna make me big man , a star on a screen
Some kind of James Brown or something in between
But when I ask for money you smother me in charms
I can't live on glory when your bendin' both my arms

I , I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion Lord, without a crown

You're living in a cave man ,upon your marble throne
You think you own the heavens, but you've got to be alone
You know I prayed for sunshine, a woman with my name
I don't want to live man, you gave away the game

I, I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion Lord , without a crown
I, I was a lion in winter
And man I had friends for miles around
I was a lion in my winter
What good's a lion Lord , without a crown
I wish there was another year, another time
When people sang and poems rhymed
My name could be Napoleon

A thousand ships, a windy sail
So huge and high, it's tall enough to touch the sky
It's beautiful but hard to find
But I just wasn't born in time

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

I can dream of growing trees
And things that live and grass that's green
In meadows that have never been
But I still place my trust in the Queen

What is life when a man is pressured
Based on wrong or right?
And I don't know what it means
There must be more we haven't seen

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end

Walking back to Waterloo again
Where do I begin?
If you play indiscreet
You can get a good seat
At the end
Country women now, what you gonna do with your life
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life
Leave my life alone
The first time I met you I knew you were the devil's daughter
You came on like a river, doin' all the things you oughta
You're a self made women, baby, not a made-to-order
If you had your way, I know you'd make me stay
And that would only bring me down

Country women now, what you gonna do with your life
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life
Leave my life alone

Country women, country women, country women
Country women, country women, ahh...

Country women now, what you gonna do with your life
Country women now, why don't you get out of this life
Leave my life alone
Leave my life alone

Country women now, country women now, country women now
Country women now, country women now, country women now
[Verse 1]
Everybody screamed
When I kissed the teacher
And they must have thought they dreamed
When I kissed the teacher
All my friends at school
They had never seen the teacher blush, he looked like a fool
Nearly petrified 'cause he was

[Verse 2]
Taken by surprise (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Couldn't quite believe his eyes (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

[Verse 3]
I was in a trance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Suddenly I took the chance (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
Leaning over me
He was trying to explain the laws of geometry
And I couldn't help it
I just had to kiss the teacher

[Chorus]
One of these days
Gonna tell him I dream of him every night
One of these days
Gonna show him I care, gonna teach him a lesson alright

[Verse 4]
What a crazy day (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
All my sense had flown away (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
When I kissed the teacher (Hug, hug him, I wanna kiss him)
My whole class went wild
As I held my breath, the world stood still, but then he just smiled
I was in the seventh heaven
When I kissed the teacher

[Outro]
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug, hug him) When I kissed the teacher
(I wanna hug...)
[Chorus]
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 1]
Friday night and the lights are low
Looking out for a place to go
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing
You come to look for a king
Anybody could be that guy
Night is young and the music's high
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Verse 2]
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone
Looking out for another, anyone will do
You're in the mood for a dance
And when you get the chance

[Chorus]
You are the dancing queen
Young and sweet, only seventeen
Dancing queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
You can dance, you can jive
Having the time of your life
Ooh, see that girl, watch that scene
Digging the dancing queen

[Outro]
Digging the dancing queen
[Verse 1]
I've seen it on your face
Tells me more than any worn-out old phrase
So now we'll go separate ways
Never again we two
Never again, nothing I can do

[Chorus]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words you try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only

[Verse 2]
I've watched you look away
Tell me, is it really so hard to say?
Oh, this has been my longest day
Sitting here close to you
Knowing that maybe tonight we're through

[Chorus]
Like an image passing by
My love, my life
In the mirror of your eyes
My love, my life
I can see it all so clearly (See it all so clearly)
Answer me sincerely (Answer me sincerely)
Was it a dream, a lie?
Like reflections of your mind
My love, my life
Are the words you try to find
My love, my life
But I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Yes I know I don't possess you
So go away, God bless you
You are still my love and my life
Still my one and only
[Verse 1]
I can hear how you work, practising hard
Playing night and day, woah woah
And it sounds better now
Yes, you improve every time you play, woah woah

[Pre-Chorus]
But it's bad
You're so sad
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

[Chorus]
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby

[Post-Chorus]
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum dum diddle, your darling fiddle

[Verse 2]
But I think you don't know that I exist
I'm the quiet kind, woah woah
From the day when I first listened to you
You've been on my mind, woah woah

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't care
It's not fair
And you're only smiling
When you play your violin

[Chorus]
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby

[Post-Chorus]
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time

[Chorus]
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
To be so near you and not just hear you
Dum dum diddle, to be your fiddle
I think then maybe you'd see me, baby

[Post-Chorus]
You'd be mine
And we'd be together all the time
Wish I was, dum dum diddle, your darling fiddle
[Verse 1: Frida]
No more carefree laughter
Silence ever after
Walking through an empty house, tears in my eyes
Here is where the story ends, this is goodbye

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

[Verse 2: Frida & Agnetha]
Memories, good days, bad days (Memories, good days, bad days)
They'll be with me always (They'll be with me always)
In these old familiar rooms, children would play
Now there's only emptiness, nothing to say

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Frida & Agnetha, Björn & Benny]
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
There is nothing we can do
Knowing me, knowing you, aha
We just have to face it, this time we're through
(This time we're through, this time we're really through)
(This time we're through, we're really through)
Breaking up is never easy, I know, but I have to go
(I have to go, this time I have to go, this time I know)
Knowing me, knowing you, it's the best I can do
[Verse 1]
I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to pay
Ain't it sad?
And still, there never seems to be a single penny left for me
That's too bad

[Pre-Chorus]
In my dreams, I have a plan
If I got me a wealthy man
I wouldn't have to work at all
I'd fool around and have a ball

[Chorus]
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

[Verse 2]
A man like that is hard to find, but I can't get him off my mind
Ain't it sad?
And if he happens to be free, I bet he wouldn't fancy me
That's too bad

[Pre-Chorus]
So I must leave, I'll have to go
To Las Vegas or Monaco
And win a fortune in a game
My life will never be the same

[Chorus]
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

[Chorus]
Money, money, money
Must be funny
In the rich man's world
Money, money, money
Always sunny
In the rich man's world
A-ha, ah
All the things I could do
If I had a little money
It's a rich man's world

[Outro]
It's a rich man's world
[Verse 1]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
What if I ain't worth the while
Not the style you'd be looking for?
If I'm sweet tonight
Things look different in the morning light
I'm jealous and I'm proud
If you hurt my feelings I'll cry out loud
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Verse 2]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Would I be the one you seek
Mild and meek like the girl next door?
Don't you realise
I may be an angel in disguise
It's lonely to be free
But I'm not a man's toy, I'll never be
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Bridge]
I don't believe in fairy tales
Sweet nothings in my ear
But I do believe in sympathy
That's me, you see

[Verse 3]
Are you sure you wanna hear more?
Won't you have a drink with me
Just to see you're not really sore?
I can't help my ways
I'm just not the girl to hide my face
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me, mhm
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me

[Interlude]

[Outro]
There's a special love
Like an eagle flying with a dove
I'll find it in the end
If I keep on searching, but until then
I'm Carrie, not-the-kind-of-girl-you'd-marry
That's me
[Verse 1: Björn]
When you were lonely, you needed a man
Someone to lean on, well I understand
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Nights can be empty, nights can be cold
So you were looking for someone to hold
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me

[Verse 2: Björn]
Men are the toys in the game that you play
When you get tired, you throw 'em away
That's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
Falling in love with a woman like you
Happens so quickly, there's nothing to do
It's only natural, but why did it have to be me?
[Chorus: Agnetha & Frida]
I was so lonesome, I was blue
I couldn't help it, it had to be you and I
Always thought you knew the reason why
I only wanted a little love affair
Now I can see you are beginning to care
But baby, believe me
It's better to forget me
[Verse 1]
The city is a jungle, you'd better take care
Never walk alone after midnight
If you don't believe me, you'd better beware
Of me

[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

[Verse 2]
The city is a nightmare, a horrible dream
Some of us will dream it forever
Look around the corner, and try not to scream
It's me

[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

[Post-Chorus]
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

[Verse 3]
The city is a prison, you'll never escape
You're forever trapped in the alleys
Look into the shadows, and you'll see the shape
Of me

[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

[Post-Chorus]
Yellow eyes are glowing like the neon lights
Yellow eyes, the spotlights of the city nights

[Chorus]
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger
People who fear me never come near me
I am the tiger

[Outro]
And if I meet you, what if I eat you?
I am the tiger
I am behind you, I always find you
I am the tiger, tiger, tiger
[Instrumental w/ Vocalisations]
[Intro]
Storm-lord, the Dreaded One
Poison of our worlds
In times of darkness, of death and decay
He grasps dominion all over
His stench hovers as shame
In the house of fratricide
An impressive depravity of a cadaverous epiphany
A profane blasphemy of the darkest atrocity

[Verse 1]
Welcome me, mortal beings
To a world a cry of fear
Incursions to evil
Shattered are your dreams
My breath, a torrid wind
Of immortal pestilence
Heaves torment, pain and anguish
Suffer in your silence

[Chorus]
Chaos, no salvation
Misery, no redemption
Twisted minds hold the key
Benevolence, I pray for thee
Drowned in fear, shrouded in black
Mourning eternally in a spiritual lethargy

[Verse 2]
Every beat of his heart
Is a death-toll chiming in a mind
As chimes grow stronger
The earth shudders in his wake
His final lament is a
Requiem to the Gods of Darkness
All deep contempt is a
Blasphemous sacrilege to his name
[Intro]
My life's minds plagued by lyssophobia
In a cage solitude locks me in
As the dar blackened walls close in on me
Dementia strikes, there's no turning back

[Verse 1]
Drowning in the stygian sea
As those voices repeat to me my malediction
Memento Mori
Remember you must die

[Verse 2]
A gratuitous wraith of violence
Blots out the light of my mind
For on this night someone must pay
For the cost of my life

[Verse 3]
For me to escape the curse of perdition
This poor, weaker being must receive pain
As you wince at the actions of my sadist ways
And cry at the throes of your moribund state

[Verse 4]
A Daemon issues your last rites
Pater Nosher Unto In Terra
I break, I twist, I burn, I destroy
Memento Mori

[Verse 5]
As the candle of life, that burned in your heart
Is doused by the grip of death's hand
Asmodeus, the spirit of lust
Bears his necrophile ways
For the wishes of the demon in black
My largesse in life should be immortality
Dislike the weak, mortal humans

[Outro]
But in life there's always death
A multitude are born to be damned
His presided body will burn forever
In the scorching flames of Gehenna
[Intro]
In the world of my subconscious, a realm of the unknown
A vision is carved by the almighty hand
The agony of a thousand souls supressed by life itself
Released unto the lord by his command
My hands are covered with the blood, the blood of his salvation
His spirit will live eternally
Take his life, by your command
A sacrifice, by your command

[Verse 1]
As I rise from my troubled sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep
Wondering if he has chosen me to do his work, I speak no blasphemy
Do I confess?
I am terrified, I cannot run, there is no place to hide
I search for help, but there's nobody there for my dream is now a recurring
...Nightmare

[Verse 2]
Brother of the holy order, I seek your help
Understand my plight, help me fight this curse that bestows me
My son you must not fight, for this is no cure
But a mission you should undertake
To free a soul from the grasp of
...Satan

[Verse 3]
So that night I did dream of mysteries untold
In the presence of the heavens was I
I could see for myself all the evils of the world
In all their morbid glory
Men took part in rites to praise the black messiah
The beast they call "The Evil One"
As voices in my head did tell me of my task
To release the soul of my only son

[Chorus]
Take his life, by your command
A sacrifice, by your command
Fill the chalice, cleanse the soul
Save him now, in the chapel of salvation
[repeat]

[Outro]
Insanity dwells in the mind of a man who will take the life of his only son
Screaming and pounding inside his head as voices whisper...
It must be done
[Intro]
Existence, throughout a spirit's will
A force, use the power of evil

Darkness, visualize
As light pierces through your yearning eyes

Rebirth of a lost soul
Your body, a channel with witch to grow old

Mephitic, smell of death
Rancid flesh, of the undead

[Chorus]
Inner screams
Useless tears
Shattered bones
My prayer...
"Oh Lord...
...Help me die."
"Please help me die."
[Verse 1]
This inner gloom
A subterranean hell
A morbid sleep
In my stygian world
My mind is locked
At chains my thoughts
I pray for death
Euthanatize my soul

Sanctify me!
[Outro]
Epitaph, to mankind
Engraved, on your mind

Stigmata, on the flesh
Dead images, put to rest
(Laughing in background)

[Dr. Trevis]
How you doing, Redman, I'm Dr. Trevis
Let's see what we have
Okay, my papers show that you strangled a white male by the name of a Mr. Van-Allen
At a rap concert, matter o' fact, Redman
My papers show that you committed the same criminal acts in 12 other states
Okay, what we're gonna do here today, Redman
Is we wanna bring some of that unnecessary anger out your system
But I can't do it alone so what I need you to do is cooperate, okay?
Nod your head up and down for yes, and side to side for no
Alright, okay, erm.. Redman, I hear that you're a rapper, correct?
Okay, If you had your chance to create your own album
In your own words, tell me
In your own words, how would you build it?
How would you make it work?
Focus your mind, focus your mind...
[Intro]
Nineteen-ninety-motherfuckin'-two
Straight from Jersey, the Phillie blunt lives on
Yo, B, tell 'em how this shit goin' down

[Chorus: B-Real & Big Daddy Kane]

[Verse 1]
(Let's get ready to rumble)
In this corner we have the funk bodysnatcher
P-Funkadelic and I gat ya
Hard enough that I can chew a whole bag of rocks
Chew an avenue, chew an off street and off block
Then turn around and do the same damn thing to a soloist
'Cause Reggie Noble's pissed
I crush the whole brain frame
'Cause you couldn't maintain the funk
That have your rap style for lunch, chump
'Cause '92, I take a whole crew
Give them a punch of the funk
Knock all of their gold tooth loose (Pow)
To show you what type of stuff I'm on, you can't puff or sniff it
Because I was born with it
The Funkadelic Devil, hit you with the rap level of ten
Then one, two, three, you're pinned
I get action, so everybody jump wit' your rump
If you like the way it sounds punk, pump it in your back trunk
And let loose with the juice when I do rock
I'm too hot, some say I got more Juice than 2Pac
Straight outta Jersey
You heard me, my brother, I'm laughin'
Time for some action

[Chorus: B-Real]
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some

[Verse 2]
Lights, camera, cock back the hammer (Explosion)
Straight from the Land of the Lost
I'ma hit you with the funk force
That make you run your rap style back to the crack aisle, brotha
Then strike a pose like Madonna
My mom's kicked me out because I did what I want ta
The original P-Funk, chump, dump a trunk of funk
In your skull caps 'cause my jaw snaps with the raw rap
So color me bad, plus color me black
For the funk that I pack, Red freak it to the funk track
(The funky fly stuff)
Come on and let me kick
(The funky fly stuff)
Just to show you where the hell I come from
I get dumb with the one, one, two
Check my rep from my hip when I have sex (Like this)
Make you twist to the list
Of a funky brain cell when it's puffed on a spliff
And all that, the hi hat, go buy that
Listen, look, oops, brother, where your eyes at?
They on the floor, pick 'em up
While I pour lyric funk down your brain, punk
Listen to my name, chump
(Redman ready to rock)
I got a Glock, then pow, your body is all over the block
Tryin' to step to this, the exorcist, kick it
I get mad wicked when Twin cock the biscuit
And blow your head off
Just for asking "Who's the one rapping?"
(Poo-pow)
Time for some action

[Chorus: B-Real]
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just (Yeah)

Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action, just
Time, time for some, time for some action

[Interlude]
Yo, 1992, Redman gets paid
Yeah, know what I'm sayin'?
We not goin' for the Okee Doke, believe that
Hit Squad is definitely in the house (In the house)
For the brothers that don't be knowin', what's up?
Word is bond, I gotta show them the flava

[Outro]
Back to the funk track like Black Sheep
My man jump say, uh
"Who's the Redman?
Where's the Redman?"
I kill, I smother, I get down with the (Yo, yo, yo, chill)
Yo, yo, Red, yo, chill, G
Chill, akh
It's over man
Yo, you don't gotta say no more, it's over
[Intro - Redman talking to himself]
Yo, yo, yo, check this out
Yo, yo we gon' go back to the old school right now
Yo, yo Red
Yo, what's up, G?
Yo, yo, yo, check this out
I believe there's no nigga out there as funky as you
True
So, what we're gonna do, is we're gonna go back to the old P
Funkadelic
Get the fuck outta here, word?
Remember that old cut you did?
Yeah, yeah
That ol' P-Funk cut?
Yeah, make my funk the P-Funk
Yeah, yeah, that's it
Well, what we gonna do is we gonna reminisce on that ol' shit
Word?
We gon' go right back to the old school, but before we do
I wanna know is my niggas in the house?
(HELL YEAH!)
I said is my motherfuckin' niggas in the house?
(HELL YEAH!)
So everybody just light your spliffs up
Yeah
Get your skunk weed and light that shit up
And let the funk be your guiding light
You heard it comin' from the lungs of the Funkadelic brother himself
More funk than a bag of skunk
Twice the funk than James Brown's socks
Hit me
Hittin' you straight across your mouth
Wit a tune
Yo, Redman, drop it

[Hook]
Make my funk the P-Funk
I wants to get funked up

[Verse]
Make my funk the P-Funk, we thump
Lyrics that bounce brains, make emcees jump
Sky high
Can't touch the level so why try?
Fall Guy compare me status to fly guy
Rough and rugged, and brother it takes ten to conquer
That's why I'm on probation
Ever since three, I cut throats of emcees
Mediocre lyricist who burnt with degrees
Of two-tens
Not from an oven, but MAC-10
A MAC-20 maybe if I didn't subtract ten
My background straight from a black man's culture
Want more?
Buy the video or Redman sculpture
For your mantle, damn you
Too hard to handle
E-Double slam once, and Redman slam two
Break hooks, earthquake shook the state of NJ
Okay, bust the big gate
For microphones that have swollen mic cords
PE fights for power
Redman fights for soul power
Funk is strong as a tree trunk
Ask me the flavor
Make mines the P-Funk

[Hook]
Make my funk the P-Funk
I want my funk uncut (Make mine the P)
Make my funk the P-Funk (Wants to get funked up)
I wants to get funked up

[Outro]
I'm back with the funk, chump
You want funk?
How many lumps?
I got spunk
I'm well-known like Donald Trump
I'm not...
[Sample]
In Los Angeles…
In Los Angeles, law enforcement officers and troops are trying to make it a calm weekend in that troubled city, as you know there has been...
Now the death toll it's up to 35
And there've been perhaps 500 injured out there
We're gonna begin our coverage with Jim Hanchek standing by in Los Angeles
Jim?
[Sample]
-Reggie...
-What the hell you doing here?
-Reggie come help me, man
-No!
[Intro]
Ahh Redman..
Do you feel that the Blacks in your community
Are still mad at the racial situation?
Yeah, they still mad
And if you don't take that funny smirk off your face
I'mma kick your...
Over three hundred ghetto-related crimes happened
In Newark, New Jersey alone — still the saga continues

[Verse 1]
Stick 'em up, stick 'em up!
I got the jammy to your guts, punk
Don't make a move!
Before I choose to make your guts run
All over the block, 'cause my stomach's in a knot
And it growls twenty-four hours a day around the tick-tock
I got roaches and rats up the back, carryin' bats and gats
So I *farting noise* 'fore I snack, Jack
I guzzle it down with water from the hydrant
My moms taking a bath and my brother's next to dive in
I gotta think of a plan so I can eat
I haven't had a cracker for weeks so my mouth leaks
I squad up, 'cause I'ma set up this kid
Carryin' loot out from Burger King and what I'ma do is...
Run up on him, snatch the bag of money, then bust the dummy!
'Cause, my man, when I think of a plan, there's no shorts take
'Cause I pack jammies inside of my North Face, coat
Had the black brother on scope
No joke's what I am 'cause the man's a pure pro
(Yo, my man you got a light?
[Straight jackin']
Yeah, give me the effin' money too, G!)
Yo, STOP, STOP, STOP!
Took the money then I dipped with the quickness
The plan went well, so I got down to the business
Opened up the bag, it was filled with paper
I thought I freaked the funk but now starts the caper
'Cause I was set up, now I have to go head up with the cops
But they carryin' black Glocks (Shit's thick!)
What's my next move?
My life's on the line
Bullets in their clips and none in mine
Sirens on, once again it's on
I fell (OW!)
and then the black Glocks went (POW!)
I got snuffed and I got bust
Now the only thing I'm sniffin' is dust, because it's...

[Hook]
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough

[Verse 2]
Me and Erick Sermon taking a trip Uptown
In the 4Runner, blastin' my tape, puffin' ganja
Since Erick got props
I stepped to this hottie with more damn body than a chop shop
Flexed the jewels then she chose to talk to me
It was no doubt that baby cakes was hawkin' me
So I kicked it, upped the digits, terrific
Not knowin' she was scopin' me 'cause I was MAD splifted
Later on that week, honeydip freaked the funk
Playin' Redman and Erick out like two chumps
Callin' him weekdays, callin' me weeknights
(Who had her weekends?)
Whichever man would freak right
Things got cozy one night like dynamite
We stripped to bare backs and took care of the bare facts
(No hats?
Damn, black) The Funkadelic
Took a splash — you know how that go, fellas
Two months later (See you later, alligator)
She was pissed and I ended up seein' my physician
She took a blood test, she took a head check
Looked at me thinkin', "Why the hell he isn't dead yet?"
Then I asked her, "Why you lookin' at me?!"
She said, "Redman, because you have the HIV"
Called Erick and his set, that girl, don't mess around!
Too late, 'cause Erick already had his drawers down
'Cause it's

[Hook]
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough
'Cause it's so rough

[Verse 3]
To all my brothers, wear your hats, wear your hats
You can either get with this or you can either catch the claps
And to my sisters, make 'em wear they prophyl-lastic
'Cause it's drastic, havin' another ghetto bastard
Think I'm dying for a piece of butt?
Honey, you must be nuts
You better settle for a wet kiss, so pucker up
'Cause you end up messin' around catchin' the heebie jeebies
Lookin' like "WHODUNNIT?"
Witcha face up on the TV
So next time you want sex, get wreck, but protect
'Cause you could be like sexin' to your last death
And if you still don't know the time, press rewind
'Cause the next thing you might hear is a flatline
Word
[BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP]
[Production by Erick Sermon & Redman]

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]
"I'm rated R, this is a warning"
"Boy you can't fuck with me!!"
[Verse 1: Redman]
Nah nah nah, fuck that!
Don't hold me back, the Funkadelic Devil just snapped
With a rap, that's shittin on the story of Jack Sprat
So put your money where your mouth is
Watch Redman house shit
And if it's beef, I'll punch you in your mouth, kid ('Damn!')
I got a heart but my heart is made out of nails
Word to Jamelle, my heart pumps nails in my blood rail
I'm not a warrior or barbarian type of nigga
I'm just quick to smoke your family then fuck your sister
That's what type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Been thinkin' about playing that nice guy role at heaven door
'Cause ever since I was an infant I was different
Paid no attention to my moms when she riffed-ed
I was a hardheaded mother-eff, but had to step
'Cause she hit me with a left, then another left
That's why my brain is out of order
Because it takes just a quarter to manslaughter your little daughter
And do a driveby—fuck that, I walk by and I spray shit
Then carve my name in your pavement
I was Rated 'X' but I flexed
I beat up the devil with a shovel so he dropped me a level
Ain't that ill?
That I could just stand and watch a bloodspill
From a known rapper, but now the rapper's no frill
Just because I made a record I'm a star, that's bullshit
What's the flavor, Tame?
(Fuck what you heard, this rated R)

[Chorus: Repeat 4X]
"I'm rated R, this is a warning"
"Boy you can't fuck with me!!"
[Verse 2]
Back to part two of the segment, the Red bend
Mics of all types, pour beer out for my dead friends
And if I didn't know ya, to hell witcha punk
And tell the devil I'll be in time for lunch (heh heh heh heh)
Got Naughty in my Nature plus I'm down with O.P.P
The best part about it, I got AIDS, bitch!
Psych, I'm only kiddin, only do it to ugly women
'Cause the pretty one's puss' smell like they went fishin
I grab my dick with a tight grip 'cause I might flip
(Yo Red, kick that hype shit on who you had a fight with!)
I had a fight with Chuck, the punk motherfuck
Tried to stab me in the gut, so I dazed him with an uppercut (BING!)
Snapped the neck on Michael Myers then I freaked it
'Cause it was August and he was talkin this trick or treat shit (Trick or treat!)
Jason my man slangs rocks like up the block
143rd and Amsterdam by the smoke shop
Norman Bates work the night shift late
Since he dresses like his mama, I pimp him and his hoecake
Bust a maneuver, Freddy Krueger
Dreamed about me havin' him scooped up
He woke up with his dukes up
That caused me to cut the hands off the man with the chainsaw
Plus I got his brain pickled in a jar
So let's get down with the funk break, 'cause they tailgate
My rap style, so to cut 'em off, I truncate
And rough 'em up, tough 'em up, like bust 'em up
With the one-two punch, like serving a customer
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
Then ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
I know, from me, THE original P-Funk
See ya next LP, chump!
[Chorus: Repeat 4X]
"I'm rated R, this is a warning"
"Boy you can't fuck with me!!"
[Hook x4]
"When I come around, homeboy, watch yo nuggets"

[Verse 1: Erick Sermon]
Chill and relax, I'm back in effect
Yes, I'm Erick Sermon, with a brand new cassette
Yes, I'm spoiled, rich like topsoil
Still loyal, still the MC Grand Royal
I'm still dope, I'm still no joke
I don't care, I'm still wild like Tone Loc
I'm swift, a.k.a.
a black stallion
Fat herringbone, with no medallion
Hello, I still got the same funk flow and yo
I still get busy like Arsenio
When I rock, I need all the girls with me
So I can be their baby tonight, like Whitney
Houston, producing a style that make a smile
To make you say, "Ooooohh chilllld!"
Bust the steps, the picture, frame it
Hall of fame it, hang it, so no one can claim it
I rule, brung my style from the Boondox
Now my shit pump in the boombox
Yo Red, my ears are ringin'
I can hear some girl singin'
*sings* Heyyyyy, Erick Serrrmon!
Heyyyayyyy!
Uhh, rock the mic honey I love the way you sway
Plus, I crush that drive me crazy
I replied, hmm... (slow down, baby, uh)
I'm ill, smooth as Johnny Gill
Gill, my my my, I pack steel
So back off, softy, here's an ice cream cone
Put down the microphone
Thank you, right about now I'm through
I'm ghost like Casper...see you!
[Hook x4]
"When I come around, homeboy, watch yo nuggets"

[Verse 2: Redman]
Funky fresh in the flesh, the Sooperman grand slams a new twist
Scoop this, Redman is milk like two tits
I stay, freshly dipped with the nine
And a clip on my hip, money-grip, no bullshit
I tic-tac on small cracks I'm all that to fall black
My jaw snap with raps, so umm, get the balls, Jack
Flavor like Flav, plus I'm well paid
Own a maid with a blade, mack daddy of the decade
At a slow rate, I sparkle like Colgate
My dick's named Machete, I stab much ho-cake
I don't have a car, but own a pair of Reeboks
It gets me where I'm going, until my damn feet stops
On and on like a switch, bust the mix
Jammm, OOPS!
I turn up the pitch
To make me boom to zoom with the tune
To make the cow jump back over the moon
It's Reggie Noble, yeahhh, I'm feelin kinda so-so
I dog you like Toto, make Rudolph nose glow
Funk out of sight with the type of hype
To make you say, umm, a 'Dyn-o-mite!'
Chiller, chiller than the Ice on Vanilla
I kill more kills than the quils from Tequila
I'm down with the green-eyed brother named Erick
Charlie, how you rate this?
(Hmm, ten like Bo Derek)
I'm deeper than a valley, peace to Cool V and Sally
PMD, my man Solo, and I'm auuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuudi...

[Hook x7]
"When I come around, homeboy, watch yo nuggets"

"When I come around, homeboy, watch yo nuggets
A master of the beatdown, my style's rugged..."
(Laugh in the background)
Okay Redman, take off your shirt and relax
Let off all your tensions out
Just relax, just relax, relax
[Sample change]
[Intro]
*inhales, starts coughing*
Yo, this is for motherfuckers, that talk that sellout shit

[Hook]
"I just want to jam for you" (repeat 2X)
"Ev-everybody get up!"
"I just want to jam for you" (repeat 2X)
"Get on up!"
[Verse 1]
"Get down, get down, on down..." like James Brown plus I get down
But for now I "Get on up!"
Rhythm and funk makes you hump
Like Technotronic, I'll make the Jam Pump
Strong to the finish when I freak the fly gimmick like
"Du-na-da-du-duh!"
without eating my damn spinach
'Cause when I'm on a roll, that's when Redman start
"to chill..." round off backflip cartwheel
"Ahhhhhh, you're nasty!"
I know
When my afro grow, that mean more rhymes to flow
But I continue, on the menu, and send you
On a jam that earthquakes the whole damn venue
It's like this, it's like that, I won't slack
I pack more steel than the cops pack blackjacks
Word is bond, the quiet storm broke your arm
When I sound off from here all the way to Hong Kong
Drop pound for pound to throwdown and strut
Yo E, what's that funk mode?
"Get on up!"
[Hook]
"I just want to jam for you" (repeat 2X)
"Ev-everybody get up!"
"I just want to jam for you" (repeat 2X)
"Get on up!"
[Verse 2]
Check this out here, let the rough cut cut your ear
Hit Squad's the crew, I'm twenty-two, and Beck's the beer
Float like Muhammad, roll-on like Secret
Me rip, the crowd in half on the sneak tip
'Til they crumble, too humble for you to stumble
I sting like a buh-bee while the others bum-bumble
Don-dan-dan, do-do-don-ding
Extremely wild, like the hair on Don King
'Cause I kick the mode to make your brain explode
It's the HUH, the funk, now I'm known around the globe
So buckle up, hush up, while I freak the funk to get down
With the sound, grab my bozack then I freeze now...
... on your mark, get ready, get set, let's go
With the flow to jet like Delta, or Jesse O-
-Wens with the Benz, I clean my front lens
With a system, that knocks harder than Rin-Tin-Tin
Without question, I'm flexy when I'm sexin'
Wicked when I Kick It like A Tribe Called Quest-in
The rude Redman rip backbones and hips to bits
Then split ya from your wrist to your armpits
But true indeed, since pop's dropped the seed
I knew I'd be, the funkiest brother that ever bleeds
Rough and rugged, more nuggets in the bucket
That's dum dum dollars, and yes Redman love it
Pound for pound, I throw down to make ya strut
Yo E, what's that funk mode?
"Get on up!"
[Hook]
"I just want to jam for you" (repeat 2X)
"Ev-everybody get up!"
"I just want to jam for you" (repeat 2X)
[Verse 1]
Ah, look out, it's the Funkadelic funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The top notch of the block, 'cause I carry a Glock
Holy hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is hummin', comin' at ya, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher, "Red, get freaky to the rapture"
So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly, Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the check a-one, two
It's you, who?
Redman with the kung fu
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the rough neck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables, I roast your whole record label, kids
Yo E (What's up, G?)
Bridge

[Chorus]
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)

[Verse 2]
I do the hustle like Russell, Rush the stage with Simmons
Deadly venom, makes me poison like Michael Bivins
Or a cobra, pop more pop than Coca-Cola
Next to Yoda, I'm a star at war, plus roller coaster
I got my mind made up, girl
Come on and get it if you with it, troop
Krush groovin' smooth as the lightning loops
The kind of loops I sample from a James Brown group
I give credit, 'cause I'm cautious about lawsuits
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real, punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean
저리 가 비켜라 몰라 가라
누구냐?
나다 나 나는 Redman
나보다 잘난~ 내~ 누구~ 나도~forget it
I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back relax let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind (Rewind)

[Chorus]
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I—)

[Verse 3]
Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman
And I hit ya with the Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectacular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Load up a course more legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can wax on, wax off like Daniel-san
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to Herb
'Cause I mac-a-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from New Jers
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode

[Chorus]
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
And you blow my mind, baby
And you blow my mind, baby (Press rewind if I haven't blown your mind)
[Intro]
(Erick Sermon: ...to make the brothers act fools)

[Verse]
I got it goin on, since I'm up next to flex
You can bet I drop heavy so girls grab your Kotex
I catch fits when I blitz a rhyme grit
And my lip gets to the point, to rip some mo' fly shit
Redman ready to rock rough rhymes
Renegade rapper, rip when it's rhyme time
Punk push a pen and pencil when I'm pissed
Pack Pistol Posse, flow some more pro shit
Fee-Fi-Foe-Fum, funky to floor, ay
Fuck ya freak words for foreplay
Quickly, quiet is kept, never quack
On the Q-Tip I quote, I throw lines like a quarterback
A monster, murder motherfucks like Manson
A madman, who mutilize men with 9-M-M
Bullets blow bad, brother back to back I slam
Bread and butter, break beats to Bam Bam
Jump off the jim before I jack my johnson
I jam like Janet, chew MC's like Swansons
Dennis stamp dummy, I'm diggin a dungeon
Can you dig that I dig deep, to destroy dumb-dumbs?
Yes, I yam what I yam when I jam, bro
My afro's in the house (YO YO YO!)
Long as I live large, life will be luxury
Ladies in Lamborghinis, love is like luck to me
Nasty nigga, competition is none
From Newark, New Jersey, knock heads like Mike Nunn
Shit, grab the steel when I'm strokin
Smoke with shotguns but the sign said no smokin
Cool it kiddo, I control from sea to sea
Cut like Chucky, plus style is cock-D
Superman Lover, cool from the new school
Hold your breath, while I walk holdin my jewels

[Hook (Repeat until scratched fade out)]

Wreck anything that's wet, when I have sex
For instance, I mix with, a style that make you shit bricks
Tsk tsk, I'm musically gifted, terrific

[Intro: Redman & Hurricane G]
Mic check, I can get smooth to any groove
Relax the tongue, let my mic take a cruise
Around the planet, pack 'em in like Janet
Jackson, she's askin' if I can slam it, I'm—
Yo, yo, Redman, man, what the fuck, man?
Get the fuck off that punk smooth shit, man
Get with that rough shit, man, you know how we do

[Verse 1: Redman]
Mic check, I walk around the streets with a black TEC-9
By the waistline, kickin' the hype shit
I never claim to be the best type of rapper
But have to show them motherfuckers what I'm after
I'm after the gold, then after that, the platinum
Beef after that, Hurricane G packs the gat, son
Trigger, bang, bang, yo, bust the slang, what my name?
It's the Redman on the funk train
Psych, you're motherfuckin' right, tonight's the night
To do what I wanna do, to do it like dynamite
The work perfected, when the funk been injected
I roughen up the rough draft to like make your head split
Punk, pass the forty and the blunt and don't front
On the block, 'cause when you do front, brothers are gettin' stomped
I'm not an addict, more like Puff the Magic
Then pass it when I'm through 'cause my crew (Gots to have it)
I don't claim to be a big rap star
'Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar
So listen up and take heed to what I'm sayin'
'Cause tonight's the night and me and my niggas ain't playin'

[Interlude]
Fat black bitch, nasty
Bush bear, booga breath bitch
Nasty, talk to your tits bitch
With them nasty Africans, Mr. Bojangles
Turned up shoes havin' ass
Lemming leprechaun haircut motherfucker

[Verse 2: Redman]
You wanna see me get cool, please, save it for the breeze
'Cause the lyrics and tracks make me funky like cottage cheese
Fuck the smooth shit, I get down with the boom bip
Like Q-Tip, I kick more styles than Bruce shoes kick
But tonight's the night what I write tonight
This type of funk with the flavor like Mike 'n' Ike's
Hanging out with my niggas, my niggas
The Pack Pistol Posse keep they fingers on the triggers
I keep the forty between my lap, coolin', rollin' down the highway
Blunt system pumps 'cause it's Friday
Roll over to pick my boys up, we raise a lot of noise
'Cause we can do that black, so "Get the Bozack", Jack
Remember, I do the type of evil that men do
Like cursin' out my window at a bitch and her friend too
So turn the volume up a notch
And watch the ba-bump
Ba-bump, make your speakers pop
That's the funk, when it pumps it makes your rump
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump
But if you wanna see a fly but frantic
Cool romantic more slicker than my man Rick
You better check the Yellow Pages under smooth shit
'Cause Red ain't down for the bullshit
Niggas fucked up by lettin' me make an album (How come, rude boy?)
To get on the mic and let my fuckin' style run

[Interlude]
Nasty fuckin' green thumb Jolly Green niggas
Tango mango, pickin' havin' ass
Nasty epileptic disease crazy havin' ass
Johnny Cash, afro havin'
Jack of Spades, boots havin'
Tony Danza, shoes wearin' ass

[Verse 3: Redman]
B-b-b-black by popular demand, I expand
My hand to the mic and let my mouth kick the flim flam
I get sex, I get wreck, I puff mad blunts
I get vexed, I break necks, punch out gold fronts, chump, you—

[Outro]
Yo, fuck that, yo, turn this shit off, man (Turn that shit off)
Turn that shit down man
Turn this shit off, G
Boom the new record on, know what I'm sayin'?
A-hem.. hit me
This is goin down
What's goin down?
Yo yo yo Reggie Noble, drop that beat in, hah!
Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh
Give it to me, give it to me

[Verse 1]
AHHHH!!
Look out, it's the Funkadelic funk for chumps
Who don't be knowin' my name, I tear the frame out ya punks
I make ya slide, make ya slip, make ya wanna backflip
I get biz with the skit, I DJ like Quik
The topnotch of the block, 'cause I carry a Glock
Only hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is HUMMIN CUMMIN ATCHA, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher: 'Red, get freaky to the rapture'
So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her
The Superfly Jimmy Fly Snuka rips the roof off
Then hook off on your crew, to the checka one, two
It's you!
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
Funky fresh in the flesh, troop
Come on and get down and boogie oogie with the roughneck
Hit women like Madonna all the way down to Smurfette
But first get your tables, I roast your whole record label, kid
Yo, Red!
(Whassup, G?)
Briiiiiidge!
[Hook 2X]
"Ooh, you blow my mind"
"All around the world for the funk"
"On and on and on and on"

Look out...AHHHHH!
[Verse 2]
Can I tear the roof off this mother?
It's the Funkdafied brother
Then I laugh, because I burn ya like Backdraft
So call the fire engine 'cause I'm flamin' up your buildin'
One life to live, so the funk is in all my children
'Cause I can get wicked like the witches from Eastwick
And freak the type of funk to make all y'all teeth grit
And crumble, my style is more flyer than the Brundle
Fly from The Fly part one, The Fly part two
PsychoBetaP-Funk, got styles hard as tree trunks
For real punk, you got a blunt, light it 'cause I need one
And get down with the irrelevant funk to make ya jump
With the fly human being, watch me freak it in Korean

Chu ri ka pi kyura mulla kara
Nu gu nya nada na na nun Redman
Na bo da challan nom hana do upda
Yi sae sang cheil eu na nun Redman, my man

I rip shop in hip-hop, I get props, my lip rocks
The rap stuff's more spooky than movies from Hitchcock
Sit back, relax, let me rip to the funk track
And press rewind if I haven't blown your mind, AHH!
[Hook]
"Ooh, you blow my mind"
"All around the world for the funk"
"On and on and on and on"
"All around the world for the funk"
"On and on and on and on"

[Verse 3]
ERRRK!
Let me get busy with the funky fly stuff
'Cause I cut your freakin' eyes out
Fuck Bruce Willis because I die rough
It's the Funkadelic Redman and I hit ya with the
Funkadelic level, the P-Funk, the devil
The spectacular, Blacula, bust holes like Dracula
Loaded, of course, more Legend than Acura
I'm swift, I like big spliffs so I tisk tisk a tasket
Plus keep the Glock in my basket.
I cough up a lung 'cause I freak it with the tongue
'Cause I can 'Wax on!
Wax off!'
like Daniel-san.
Do the yea yea, boogey say up jump the boogey
To the boogey to the boogey
Thanks to E 'cause he hooked me
So fuck what ya heard, word to herb
'Cause I mac-frama-lama
Plus I kick the grammar, straight from NEW JERZ
It's the renegade rap Redman, really who rip rhymes in rough mode
Yo, hold your breath while I explode!
HAH!
[EXPLOSION]
[Verse 1]
I get mad wicked (fuck around) and catch a bad one by the funker
I puff the mad spliffs and roll blunts with Archie Bunker
'Cause my brain is twisted, so I cock the biscuit
'Cause shit's thick, some say I'm a bastard of a swift bitch
Negro, funkin' it with the style in your ear, bro
To make you fear me like Cape without Robert DeNiro
You big pussy, so funky that you have to douche me
You can't hear me then my record label didn't push me
I know I'm sayin' 'funk' too many times in my rhymes
But if I wasn't that, I wouldn't freak it in the line
But it don't seems to matter 'cause my shit get fatter and fatter
I'll do the funk in your face and it slaps ya
How does it feel with the face full of funk
With the bass in your trunk, weed laced with the blunt
I puff, I never got snuffed, bust while I dust your monkey
Ass off then I just crush on the hush hush
So if you want a taste of the funk from the gutter
Ask the brothers (Why?)
'Cause I'm bad (Word to mother)

[Hook]
I'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)
I'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed
I'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)
I'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed

[Interlude]
Yo yo, check this out
This is for y'all hokey-pokey punk pussy motherfuckers
Just to show y'all I do what the fuck I wanna do
I want y'all to check this on the real
And yo, check this out
Shake it!

C'mon shake it!
C'mon shake it!

Hahahahah
(Yo Red, c'mon, get back to the track man, I wanna get out of here!)
Yo kid chill, a'ight, a'ight, check it out

[Verse 2]
Flexy I'm sexy when I'm standin' in my drawers
If you can't check me when I'm rappin', put the tape on pause
And listen to the incredible shit that I kick my man
Give me five on the backhand then stick
Your finger in a hole and chop the stick quick
'Cause my lip get to the point, to STILL rock the fly shit
Since you're holding your breath, I hold my jewels
I swing hardcore, so I walk, holdin' my tools
The original P-Funk, takes no junk, from a chump, or punk, G
I been this way every since nine months
So get down while I rip the raps from my lip 'cause
My shit's more deep than any tape from Enigma
The gettin' nice, thinkin' killer brother who pop trash
Basic instinct — I'm a shooter so they got blasted
Much ass I kick, groove to the master mix
My song still pumps when it's not even mastered, bitch!
My shit's very chronic so rewind it
'Cause it's like.. eh-eh-eh-eh beyond, bionic!
'Cause I'm a wild and crazy guy!
No lie!
Last brother to battle me I started pissin' in his eye
I'm bad, word to mother, to the motherfuckin' Hubbard
Eatin' her curds and whey, puffin spliffs 'cause she doesn't
And if you still don't under-fuckin-stand where I'm comin' from
Listen to my nine, understand where it's hummin' from!
[Hook]
I'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)
I'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed
I'm a bad... Yo, word to the mother (x3)
I'm a bad... Bad bad, and a wicked in bed

[Intro]
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww SHIT!!
Check it out
Yo, 1992 begins a new wave for the blunt rollers
You know what I'm sayin'?
The saga of the Phillie Blunt continues
The flava's the P-Funk y'all, get wit it
Check it out...

[Verse 1]
Check out a new type of gimmick which is splendid
Since you're down with other shit, let's see if you're down with this
It's about strictly trying to roll a blunt
When you get the hang of it, you'll carry more blunts than Archie Bunk'
First of all, you get a fat bag of ism
From Uptown, any local store sells the shit, friend
Purchase a Phillie—not the city of Philly, silly punk
I'm talking about the cigar, the Phillie Blunt
Lick the blunt and then the Phillie Blunt middle you split
Don't have a razor blade, use your fuckin' fingertips
Crack the bag and then you pour the whole bag in
Spread the ism around until the ism reach each end
Take your finger and your thumb from tip to tip
Roll it in a motion, then the top piece you lick
Seal it, dry it wit your lighter if ya gotta
The results, mmmmmmmm....proper

[Hook]
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up

That's how you roll a blunt

(Peace to Pete Rock)
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up, yeah

[Verse 2]
The second paragraph might makes you laugh
When a brotha rolls a blunt and his breath smells like pure ass
That's when you know you gotta take the blunt from him
'Cause his breath has the dragon in the dungeon
(Yo, yo, yo, light the blunt.
uh yo, here's the lighter..)
I would if this shit would stop drippin' wit saliva
And if you gonna lick it, don't drown it with your spit, shit
I dunno what dick or last puss' you licked quick
And how 'bout the non-blunt rollin' females
That always fucks it up 'cause they don't wanna break their Lee nails
(hee hee hee hee hee, sorry Red for spilling it...)
[BEEEITCH] You better pickup every seed of it
Because I paid 10 bills for the get ill
And for spilling it, you better get lost or get grill
Bo know everything from sports to other stuff
But I bet you Bo don't know to roll a blunt

[Hook]
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up

That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt
That's how you roll a blunt

That's how you roll a blunt
Let's all roll a blunt...and get fucked up, yeah

("Hey, nigga, pass the goddamn blunt.
Shit!
What you holding it all day for?)
Sit yo' big ass down...

[Outro]
Yo, yo, check this out
I want all the real niggas out there and the females too
If you got a fat blunt in ya mouth and you feeling high as hell
I want y'all to repeat after me, check it out
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...)
I'm fucked up (I'm fucked up...)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell...)
I'm high as hell (I'm high as hell)
Yeah

Last but not least, Redman like to say peace
To all the blunt rollers from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme a blunt when I kick the bucket
Devil or no devil, when high, I am the wrong one to be fucked with
So everybody, put they blunt up in the air
Take a puff, blow the smoke out like ya just don't care
So...(pump up the volume)...so it's heard thru the next block
I'm out, peace to Redd Foxx, I'm off to the cess spot...

Yeah, DJ Twinz in the house
Yeah, Redman's in the house
Yo, peace to Pack Pistol Posse, the 4,5,6
Yo, I'm out

-Hee hee hee hee, no!
It's Sooperman Lover, baby!
Yeah
-Daddy, Daddy!
Would you please tell me a story?
-Alright, get over here and sit yo' big ass down
Lemme tell you about the Sooperman Lover...

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I was out for lunch and shit, puffin' on a blunt to get my head wrecked
Boogie'n to my Walkman with an "S" on my chest
(Bust a move!)
Yes, I'm a superhero, don't forget
I smoke mad niggas so to hell with cigarettes
But anyway, let's get back to this skit
You know who the fuck I am, so git off that ol' bull-
Shucks!
Lunchtime was up—FUCK!
Let me jet, or I'll collect unemployment bucks
On the way back, Jack, I spotted this object, a stray cat
Stuck in a tree, with a tag that says that:
"If found, please return to this address"
(How did you see it?)
Nigga, with my X-ray eye set!
Like "Pchoooooooww", I jetted to the closest phone-booth
Quick flash, I dipped into my Sooperlover suit...
(Johnny 'Guitar' Watson: I can leap tall buildings...yeah...
In a single bound...)
Boom!
Right through the fuckin' phone booth ceiling
(It's a, it's a plane!)
Nah, Sooperman Lover's the name
I can slam King Kong and pick up freight trains
On a mission, to save this cat that was wishin'
He was in his litter, watchin' Fritz on channel 6'n
Relaxin', feet cocked up, just a little
With a cod cocktail and a bowl of tender vittles
I snatched him, took off through the air like a pigeon
Quick so he won't start meowin' and bitchin'
Then landed at the cat's tag address in the projects
(Elevator's broken!)
So I had to take the back steps
(Knock, Knock) The door opened then my eyes swole
From this badass honey sippin' a quart of Old Gold
"Yo, is this your cat?"
"Awww, yes!
Where'd you find him at?"
"He was stuck in a tree up by uptown Manhattan"
"Well, how the hell did you save him?
Are you police undercover?"
"Naw baby the "S" on my chest stands for"

[Hook]
Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong...
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...

[Verse 2]
She was grateful, lookin' for ways to repay me
No money, a donut, and some..uhm coffee maybe?
"Of course, what kind to show that I thank ya?"
"Make my donut jelly, and my coffee Sanka"
We sat, unhooked the cape from my back
She felt my arms 'cause my pythons looked stacked
"Goddamn, Sooperlover!
Yo shit look thick
Tell me, how strong are you with muscles like this?
You bad motherfucker!"
(I'm stronger than a locomotive)
Akhi hit ya like Rocky
She dashed to the room and came back with an ounce
Negligee, high-heeled shoes with a blunt in her mouth
Ready to roll up, hey hold up, she had the dollar fold up
To mix the coke with the smoke, yo, she was no joke
She took a sniff, some got on her top lip
That bitch stuck out her tongue and gave her top lip a lick
And said: "Here baby, hit it."
"Naw baby, I ain't wit' it
You'd need more than a body to make me wanna sniff that shit!"
But I'll hit the blunt, so she took out her fronts
Cracked the Phillie, opened the bag, and laid out the skunk
Then I took a long pull, it was hype, oughta sight
She ran into the bedroom so I cracked my pants for head room
Later, tossed the cover and, oh brother, I was wit' it
Ready to hit it asked my dick (Yo, wassup, G?)
Yo, man, shit's thick
Licked her on her belly then kissed her down her back
Stuck my hands between the legs and I felt the bozack
As big as mine (Ewwww!)
This bitch must be craze
So I threw my suit on and I was Swayze...
'Cause I'm the

[Hook]
Sooperman Lover, yeah
Said they call me the Sooperman Lover, yeah
But something wrong...
There's something wrong with me
There's something wrong, yeah, yes it is...

Damn!

Oh, yeah—it ain’t over, motherfuckers

I'm fallin' in love again

Fall in love again
Yeehe

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Uhuhooo

I could never see
What fate had planned for me
And then you came
And made a dream
My reality
Maybe you can't see
All the things you've lead to me
Well my simple fate is at the gate
And boy, you've got the key

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Ohhh yeh

It seems like yesterday
You and I first loved this way
But now I know
How love can grow
With each and every day
As we lay at midnight hour
And feel loves hidden power
So strong and bold as life
Unfolds the mystery to me

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Hehey

I never dream
That my summertime
Flame could show me
How much pleasure
The winter can bring
Hooked up by the fireplace
Time I don't waste
As I love you slow
Then increase the pace
Your natural body perfume
Brightens up any room
One whiff and my spirits taken up-lift
It feels good
When your woman is your best friend
But it's better
When you fall in love again

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Where do you, where do you go
Where do you, where do you go
You have been hurt, and now you think love's a big cheat
But I know if you allow me I'll prove you wrong
Don't be afraid of the love you have for me
Let me bear- and let things happen, be aware- we each have the chance

If you're restless, I will follow you
If you're weak I'll give you strength
If you can't go on I'll see you through
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

Trust in me baby, I would never let you down
And I swear my loves a cure for your broken heart
(Let me cure your broken) heart
I want you so, I will read the wishes in your eyes
And I will chase the dark clouds away, if you give me one more chance

If you're restless, I will follow you
If you're weak I'll give you strength
If you can't go on I'll see you through
I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there

If the world seems to be down on you, if you're badly off for health, if you need someone to comfort you, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there!
Let me cure your broken heart, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be there.
Boy you know I'm gonna be there.
Believe me when I say I'm gonna be there

If the world seems to be down on you, if you're badly off for health, if you need someone to comfort you, I'll be there, I'll be there, I'll be there!
Do you still need me, there's a look in your eyes
You wouldn't leave me, not for a moment
'Cause when your sleeping, you don't reach out to hold me tight
I'm a fool for those things like you still need me
Do you still love me, is it love anyway
You live in you world, and I can't follow
If you still need me, then I wish I could hear you say
I'm a fool for those things like you still love me

(What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do, hat ya gonna do If I can't tell you)
I can't tell you (what ya gonna do, what ya gonna do, what ya gonna do)
If I run away

Do you still need me, do tears cloud my mind
Sometimes I wonder, just where were heading
I can remember, thoses we had were the best of times
I'm a fool for those things like you still need me

(What ya gonna do, what ya gonna do, hat ya gonna do If I can't tell you)
I can't tell you (what ya gonna do, what ya gonna do, what ya gonna do)
If I run away

I'll never go never go til I hear you say...

Do you still need me, like you did the first time
You wouldn't leave me, not for a moment
Where are your kisses, that would keep me awake all night
I'm a fool for those things like you still need me
Do you still love me, was it love anyway
You live in you world, and I can't follow
If you still need me, then I wish I could hear you say
I'm a fool for those things like you still love me

Do you still need me...

Love to love, girl take a cue
Love to love it me and you

Another starry night in September
Another chance for romance
And one more time for me to surrender
To put myself in a trance

The heat is on
The heat is on

We're gonna make tonight last forever
And leave all our troubles behind
Lets beat the clock, lets do it together
I'll show you what's on my mind

The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on

Another starry night in September
Another chance for romance
And one more time for me to surrender
To put myself in a trance

The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on
The heat is on

Ya'll save ya, shake what your mamma gave ya
Have to adapt it in a beat that's phat
Heres the facts, La Bouche is all that
Crowds getting loud, and their begging us just to get on down
Everywhere we go is a stomping ground
Ten-thousand people with their hands in the air, screaming out "Oh yeah"
My ?

Mamma's got a brand new bag
Should be a crime to think it don't rhyme
Come on and hit me one time (huh)

Shoo bee do bee do I like that way
Boy I need you every single day
Shoo bee do bee do I've found my way
Straight into your heart please let me stay

I wanna take it nice 'n' slow

Well baby from the first time I saw you, I knew I had to have you
I just couldn't wait any longer, I want you body and soul

When I first saw you , you looked so fine you blew my mind I just knew that I was seein' a dream
Tryin' to maintain my composure as I made my move to call you over to sit next to me
You looked my way with your sexy smile, I felt just like a schoolgirl
I was so nervous I could not move, with one look you rocked my world

Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow
If you say you like it I will never let you go

I called you up, to my surprise, you remembered me, you were waiting for me to dial your number
Wanted to see me, no hesitation came from me, must of been that magic spell I was under
So beautiful, just one night with you, I can't imagine it all
So you just open up your heart come and share my dream, together we can fly away

Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow
If you say you like it I will never let you go

Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow
If you say you like it I will never let you go

Baby don't you wanna take control of me, let me be your one and only fantasy
Given myself to you totally...
(Body and Soul)
Baby don't you wanna take control of me, let me be yor your one and only fantasy, given myself to you totally...
(I promise my love nice and slow)

Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow
If you say you like it I will never let you go

Don't you want to try it we can take it nice 'n' slow

And made a dream
My reality

All the things you've lead to me
Well my simple fate is at the gate
And boy, you've got the key

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love

With each and every day
As we lay at midnight hour
And feel loves hidden power
So strong and bold as life
Unfolds the mystery to me

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Hehey

I never dream
That my summertime
Flame could show me
How much pleasure
The winter can bring
Hooked up by the fireplace
Time I don't waste
As I love you slow
Then increase the pace
Your natural body perfume
Brightens up any room
One whiff and my spirits taken up-lift
It feels good
When your woman is your best friend
But it's better
When you fall in love again

Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again
Everyday I love you more and more
Baby, Baby, fallin' in love
I'm fallin' in love again

Happy New Year, first of all
I hope we have about a million, or two million more of them
If we can get over this summer; hehehe
I'd like to dedicate this one to, uh
The draggy scene that's going on
All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York
Oh yes, and all the soldiers fighting in Vietnam
I'd like to do a thing called "Machine Gun"

[Refrain]
Machine gun
Tearing my body all apart
Machine gun

You know what I mean?
Hey, and your bullets keep knocking me down
Hey, I pick up my axe and fight like a farmer now
Yeah, but you still blast me down, to the ground

[Verse 3]
The same way you shoot me down, baby
You'll be going just the same
Three times the pain
And your own self to blame
Hey, machine gun

[Verse 4]
I ain't afraid of your mess no more, babe
I ain't afraid no more
After awhile your, your cheap talk won't even cause me pain
So let your bullets fly like rain
Because I know all the time you're wrong baby
And you'll be going just the same

[Refrain]
Yeah, machine gun
Tearing my family apart
Yeah, yeah, alright
Tearing my family apart

Don't you shoot him down
He's about to leave here
Don't you shoot him down
He's got to stay here
He ain't going nowhere
He's been shot down to the ground
Oh where he can't survive no, no

[Outro]
Yeah, that's what we don't want to hear anymore, alright

And that's the reason why she had to part

[Chorus]

Shoot down some of those airplanes you've been driving
Especially the ones that fly too low
Shoot down some of those airplanes you've been driving
Especially the ones that fly you too low
Come on back to earth, my friend
Come on back up with me
We all been through the night time, babe
Now let's reap the waves of reality

[Chorus]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible

[Verse 2]
Playing too much with one toy tends to lead
Into the foggy
It's so groovy to float around, sometimes even
A jellyfish will tell you that
I said flotation is groovy and easy
Even a jellyfish will agree to that
Yeah, but old jelly's been floating so long
And so slack, lord, and don't gotta bone in his jelly back
Floating every day and every night, riding high is a risk
Sometimes the wind ain't right

[Chorus]
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything is possible

With the power of you anything you want to do
With the power of you anything you want to do

With the power of soul anything is possible
With the power of soul anything that you want to do
With the power

Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I send a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today

Well I am what I am, thank God
Some people just don't understand what I'm about
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool baby
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come on along with me
Don't mess with your man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
And then prove to the man
You're as strong as him
Cause in the eyes of God
You're both chewin' it to him

Everybody come alive
Everybody love all night
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message

[Verse 1]
Lashing out the action, returning the reaction
Weak are ripped and torn away
Hypnotizing power, crushing all that cower
Battery is here to stay

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 2]
Crushing all deceivers, mashing non-believers
Never-ending potency
Hungry violence-seeker, feeding off the weaker
Breeding on insanity

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery

[Verse 3]
Circle of destruction, hammer comes crushing
Powerhouse of energy
Whipping up a fury, dominating flurry
We create the battery

[Chorus]
Smashing through the boundaries, lunacy has found me
Cannot stop the battery
Pounding out aggression, turns into obsession
Cannot kill the battery
Cannot kill the family, battery is found in me
Battery, battery
Battery, battery
[Verse 1]
End of passion play, crumbling away
I'm your source of self-destruction
Veins that pump with fear, sucking darkest clear
Leading on your death's construction

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

[Verse 2]
Needlework the way, never you betray
Life of death becoming clearer
Pain monopoly, ritual misery
Chop your breakfast on a mirror

[Refrain]
Taste me, you will see, more is all you need
Dedicated to how I'm killing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

[Post-Chorus]
(Master, master, master, master)

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Bridge]
Master, master, where's the dreams that I've been after?
Master, master, you promised only lies
Laughter, laughter, all I hear or see is laughter
Laughter, laughter, laughing at my cries
Fix me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Hell is worth all that, natural habitat
Just a rhyme without a reason
Never-ending maze, drift on numbered days
Now your life is out of season

[Refrain]
I will occupy, I will help you die
I will run through you, now I rule you too

[Pre-Chorus]
Come crawling faster (Faster)
Obey your master (Master)
Your life burns faster (Faster)
Obey your

[Chorus]
Master, master
Master of puppets, I'm pulling your strings
Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams
Blinded by me, you can't see a thing
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master
Just call my name 'cause I'll hear you scream
Master, master

[Laughter]
[Verse 1]
Messenger of fear in sight
Dark deception kills the light
Hybrid children watch the sea
Pray for Father, roaming free

[Chorus]
Fearless wretch
Insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness, you dwell

[Verse 2]
Crawling chaos, underground
Cult has summoned, twisted sound
Out from ruins once possessed
Fallen city, living death

[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Timeless sleep, has been upset
He awakens, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
In madness you dwell

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Not dead, which eternal lie
Stranger eons death may die
Drain you of your sanity
Face the thing that should not be

[Chorus]
Fearless wretch, insanity
He watches, lurking beneath the sea
Great Old One, forbidden site
He searches, hunter of the shadows is rising
Immortal
In madness you dwell
[Verse 1]
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep, my friend, and you will see
That dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says "rage"?
[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Build my fear of what's out there
I cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell

[Chorus]
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone

[Bridge]
Sanitarium
(Just leave me alone)

[Outro]
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again
[Verse 1]
Bodies fill the fields I see, hungry heroes end
No one to play soldier now, no one to pretend
Running blind through killing fields, bred to kill them all
Victim of what said should be, a servant 'til I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

[Chorus]
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

[Verse 2]
Barking of machine-gun fire does nothing to me now
Sounding of the clock that ticks, get used to it somehow
More a man, more stripes you wear, glory seeker trends
Bodies fill the fields I see, the slaughter never ends

[Pre-Chorus]
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

[Chorus]
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man

[Bridge]
Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Why am I dying?
Kill, have no fear
Lie, live off lying
Hell, hell is here
I was born for dying

[Verse 3]
Life planned out before my birth, nothing could I say
Had no chance to see myself, molded day by day
Looking back I realize, nothing have I done
Left to die with only friend, alone, I clench my gun

[Pre-Chorus]
Soldier boy, made of clay, now an empty shell
Twenty-one, only son, but he served us well
Bred to kill, not to care, do just as we say
Finished here, greeting death, he's yours to take away

[Chorus]
Back to the front
You will do what I say when I say
Back to the front
You will die when I say you must die
Back to the front
You coward, you servant, you blind man
Back to the front

[Outro]
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
Back to the front
[Intro: Lars Ulrich]
One, two
One, two, three, four, one

[Verse 1: James Hetfield]
Spineless from the start, sucked into the part
Circus comes to town, you play the lead clown

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Please, please, spreading his disease
Living by his story
Knees, knees, falling to your knees
Suffer for his glory, you will

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah

[Verse 2: James Hetfield]
Marvel at his tricks, need your Sunday fix
Blind devotion came, rotting your brain

[Pre-Chorus: James Hetfield]
Chain, chain, join the endless chain
Taken by his glamour
Fame, fame, infection is the game
Stinking drunk with power, we see

[Chorus: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat
Bow to leper messiah

[Bridge: James Hetfield]
Witchery, weakening
Sees the sheep are gathering
Set the trap, hypnotize
Now you follow

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro: James Hetfield]
Time for lust, time for lie
Time to kiss your life goodbye
Send me money, send me green, heaven you will meet
Make a contribution and you'll get a better seat
Lie, lie, lie, lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie!
[Bass Intro]

[Verse 1]
Dealing out the agony within
Charging hard and no one's going to give in
Living on your knees, conformity
Or dying on your feet for honesty
Inbred, our bodies work as one
Bloody, but never cry submission
Following our instinct not a trend
Go against the grain until the end

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

[Verse 2]
Slamming through, don't fuck with razorback
Stepping out?
You'll feel our hell on your back
Blood follows blood and we make sure
Life isn't for you and we're the cure
Honesty is my only excuse
Try to rob us of it, but it's no use
Steamroller action crushing all
Victim is your name and you shall fall

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here
(Damage Incorporated)

[Bridge]
We chew and spit you out
We laugh, you scream and shout
All flee, with fear you run
You'll know just where we come from
(Damage Incorporated)
Go

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Damage jackals ripping right through you
Sight and smell of this, it gets me going
Know just how to get just what we want
Tear it from your soul in nightly hunt
Fuck it all and fucking no regrets
Never happy ending on these dark sets
All's fair for Damage Inc., you see
Step a little closer if you please

[Chorus]
Blood will follow blood
Dying time is here

Show me, show me the way
Take a bus, a train or a plane to Hollywood
Go there and then change your name
You dye your hair out there, it's part of the game
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Tell the bank that you need a loan
Go sell your house and every little thing that you own
You'll make your dream, forget what you've ever known
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Now you're set, so follow the rules
Don't need a house unless it comes with the pool
Buy some new clothes and then you've got to be cool
You're gonna be a star, big star, listen here

Find a beach if you need a tan
You got to act as though you're in great demand
Be first class, don't ever think second hand
You're gonna be a star, a big star

(In sty-y-y-yle) get in style (L.A. sty-y-y-yle)

Let's go to (Holly-Hollywood) Hollywood (Holly-Hollywood) so good
(Holly-Hollywood, Holly-Hollywood) come on

Now it's time to get a new car
You know the kind that has a phone and a bar
You'll soon forget the per-son you really are
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Party where the stars have their fun
The Candy Store or Pips or Studio One
Act like a king and soon New-Yorkers look up
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Never run to answer the phone
Just let it ring, pretend you're just getting home
Play a good game, you see you'll never go wrong
You're gonna be a star, a big star

Tell your friends you walked off the stage
Then slip outside and call and have yourself paged
Get on the phone and scream as though in a rage
You're gonna be a star, a big star

(In sty-y-y-yle) be in style (L.A. sty-y-y-yle) L.A. sty-y-y-yle

[Spoken Intro]
Hey fuckers!
Suck on Guns N' fuckin' Roses!
[Verse 1]
I am reckless and feeling no pain
You know I have got no need to control
Living with the danger, I am always on the edge now
With million dollar visions that I hold
Living like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain and you know I know my part

[Verse 2]
On a holiday, a permanent vacation
I'm living on a cigarette with wine
I am never alone because I have got myself
Yes, I imitate myself all of the time
Living like this never ever tore my life apart
I know how to maintain because it is coming from my heart

[Bridge]
I lead a reckless life and I don't need your advice
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only vice

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Reckless life, I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only
Reckless life, I lead a reckless life
I lead a reckless life and you know it's my only
[Verse 1]
She hit town like a rose in bloom
Smelling sweet, said sweet perfume
The color faded and the petals died
Down in the city, no one cried

[Pre-Chorus]
In the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
The roaches so big, you know that they got bones
They moved in and made a tenement home

[Chorus]
I said, "Nice boys don't play rock and roll"
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy

[Verse 2]
Sweet sixteen she was fresh and clean
Wanted so bad to be part of the scene
She met the man and she did the smack
Paid the price laying flat on her back

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanted so bad just to please the boys
They ended up just being a toy
Played so hard burned her life away
Lies were told no promises made

[Chorus]
You know, nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'm not a nice boy and I never was

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
Young and fresh when she hit town
Hot for kicks just to get her ass around
But now she lays in a filthy room
She kills the pain with a flick and a spoon

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the streets, the garbage lies
Protected by a million flies
You know the roaches so big, you know that they got bones
Moved in and made a tenement home

[Chorus]
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll

[Outro]
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Na, na, na na, na, na, baby
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
I'll bet your mamma said
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys don't play rock and roll
Nice boys
[Verse 1]
You pack your bags and you move to the city
There is something missing here at home
You fix your hair and you are looking real pretty
It's time to get it out on your own
You are always fighting with your mama and your papa
Your family life is one big pain
When you, you gonna move to the city
Into the city where it all began

[Chorus 1]
You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, time you gotta move

[Solo 1]

[Verse 2]
You stole your mama's car and your daddy's Plastic credit card
You are sixteen and you can't get a job you're not going very far
You are always riding with the teachers and the police
This life is much too insane
When you, you are going to move to the city
Into the city where it all began

[Chorus 1]
You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, time you gotta move

[Chorus 2]
Right to the city where the real men get it
Child isn't it a pity
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me

[Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
You are on the streets and it isn't so pretty
You need to get a new what you please
You do what you got to do for the money
At times you end up on your knees
I am always buying with the local and the junkies
This city life is one big pain
But you, you had to move to the city
Into the city where it all began

[Chorus 1]
You gotta move, you gotta move
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, time you gotta move

[Chorus 2]
Oh right to the city with the real nitty gritty
Aw, child isn't it a pity
Sometimes it gets too shitty
Come on and hit me
[Intro]
This is the song about your fucking mother

[Verse]
It ain't easy living like a gypsy
Telling you, honey, how it feels
I've been dreaming, floating downstream
And losing touch with all that's real
Whole lot of lover, keeping undercover
Never knowing where you been, oh yeah
You've been fading, always out parading
Keep in touch with mama kin
You always got your tail on the wag
Spitting fire from your mouth just like a dragon
You act like a perpetual drag
You better check it out 'cause someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon

[Chorus 1]
It isn't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you got to say 'shee-it'
But don't forget to drop me a line

[Chorus 2]
Bald as an egg at eighteen
And working for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon

[Chorus 3]
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and smokin' tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Livin' out your fantasy
Sleepin' late and suckin' me, oh no

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 1]
It ain't easy living like you wanna
It's so hard to find piece of mind, yes it is
The way I see it, you got to say 'shee-it'
But don't forget to drop me a line

[Chorus 2]
Bald as an egg at eighteen
And working for daddy's such a drag
You still stuff your mouth with his beans
You better check it out or someday soon
You gonna climb back on the wagon

[Chorus 3]
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and smoking tea
Keep in touch with mama kin
Tell her where you gone and been
Living out your fantasy
Sleeping late and sucking me, oh no, no, no, yeah
Last time I saw him
He sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him
He said:"I'll be back for more of this"
Last time I saw him
We were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving
But he had to set us up

I gave him money
I know I invested well
Mamma doesn't trust him
But he loves me I can tell

Each time the greyhound
Arrives at nine o' clock
But I don't start my crying
'Till that last man's gotten off

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
But I'm still waiting here
Without a fear
That bus will someday turn around

I had no letter
It's been six months, maybe better
I try forgetting him
But I love him more then ever

I have decided
I've waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong
He would return right on that bus

There must be trouble
So I'm leavin' on the double
If he can't get to me
I know he needs me desperately

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine

La de da, la da do
Do la da da, da da da

Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine
Darlin'...
You know you've got the cruelest streak
You only say you love just to
Keep me weak
Your loving words have kept me here for
Many years
I'm leavin...I'll face the tears
You know that

No-one's gonna be a fool forever
Ain't no-one gonna be a fool for life
No-one's gonna be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye

Beautiful plans are hard to forget
You promised me a family
A little girl with braids skipping
Off to school
A part of you and me will never be
You know that

No-one's gonna be a fool forever
Ain't no-one gonna be a fool for life
No-one's gonna be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye

No-one's gona be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye

Darlin
I'm leaving you, but with regrets
Everything I have for you is gone
There's nothing left
You had me apologize for things
I didn't do
To keep my self-respect
I'm leaving you
You know that

No-one's gonna be a fool forever
Ain't no-one gonna be a fool for life
No-one's gonna be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye
Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Hey, the touch of your hands
Awakens feelings deep inside me
You know
The warmth of your breath
Is like a soft wind sent to guide me
All those sweet sensations
Let me feel them now

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Oh, we're starting together
I feel your love is flowing through me
You know
Whatever you're doing
I love the way
You do it to me
All those sweet sensations
Let me feel them now
Ooh

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Ooh
I see the love on your face is glowing
I feel your lovin' inside me growin'
I know exactly just where you're goin'
Let me come with you

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too
Johnny's been runnin' hard all his life
'Cause life never treated him right
Well he ain't running now
You see his eyes are closed
They can't hurt him tonight

Sleepin', he's sleepin'
Just let him be for a while
Don't wake him, don't take him
To where the people don't smile

Sleepin', my man is sleepin' nice now
Please let him stay here with me
I promise, I'll keep him
At home, where he's supposed to be

He's been out there
In the streets you know
And strugglin', scufflin'
Trying to survive
Out there in a richman's world
And now you say my Johnny is not alive
But you're wrong, can't you see

Sleepin', he's just sleepin' mister
He doesn't rest very much
He lives hard and he gives hard
And I'll just die for his touch

Sleepin', he's sleepin'
Without a care to his name
He's peaceful
He's quiet
He's tired of runnin' his game

He's been out there
In the streets you know
With all the pain and all the suffering
Out there
Where you fight like hell
He never learned a fix don't fix a thing
Don't touch him

Johnny put too much in his vanes
And now you're trying to tell me he's gone
I don't believe you
I'm just gonna sit here
And rock him in my arms

Sleepin', he's sleepin'
He doesn't rest very much
You see he lives hard and gives hard

Turn around and you're two
Turn around and you're four
Turn around and you're a young girl
Going out of the door

Turn around
Turn around
Turn around and you're a young girl
Going out of the door

Where are you going my little one, little one
Little dirndls and petticoats, where are you now
Turn around and you're tiny
Turn around and you're grown
Turn around and you're a young wife
With babes of your own

Turn around
Turn around
Turn around and you're a young wife
With babes of your own

Turn around

Remember me
A face you used to see
Not the same song that I used to be
I had their words passing through me
But I just can't find the rhymes
I've been every place but right so many times

When will I come home to you
Whenever you want me to
It's a cold and lonely world
When you're not loving me

Your world is my only one
I'm back where I started from
There's no place that I would rather be

Remember me
The girl who thought that she
Could get lost in unreality
I've been around up and down
I've never missed a single rhyme
I've been everything there is but satisfied

When will I come home to you
Whenever you want me to
It's a cold and lonely world
When you're not loving me

Your world is my only one
I'm back where I started from
There's no place that I would rather be

When will I come home to you
Whenever you want me to
It's a cold and lonely world
When you're not loving me

Your world is my only one
I'm back where I started from
There's no place that I would rather be

When will I come home to you
Whenever you want me to
It's a cold and lonely world
When you're not loving me

Your world is my only one
I'm back where I started from
Like a bat out of hell and a fire deep within ya
You came from a place I’ve never been in West Virginia
I let you burn me, I let you turn me around

Like the lick of a flame you seared the soul within me
Your warm brown eyes hid the evil and gave no pity
I let you burn me, I let you turn me around

I heard a love song but you never made a sound
I heard a love song and you were coming up as I went down

Like a blanket of ice you caught the burning embers
It was a late July but it damn well felt like near December
I let you burn me, I let you turn me around
Oh, I let you burn me, I let you turn me around

I heard a love song but you never made a sound
I heard a love song and you were coming up as I went down
(repeat)
What is a love song sung to a lady
Who has been a lady so long
So long that her cloth is wearing thin
A momma unwed, alone in her bed
She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

What good is a word said to the man
Who doesn't hear
What meant to be heard
The voice of her child cryin' in fear
His hunger inside
She can't feed with pride

She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

She went down to the country
To find a wishing well
But the country had gone to the city
And the city had gone to hell

She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

She is cold, is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

She is cold, she is clay
She can't find a better way
She is Stone liberty
Love alone won't set her free

[... fade out]
My baby makes me proud
Lord, don't he make me proud
He never makes a scene
By hangin' all over me in a crowd

'Cause people like to talk
Lord, don't they like to talk
But when they turn out the lights
I know he'll be leavin' with me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then I let my hair hang down
He makes me glad that I'm a woman
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

My baby makes me smile
Lord, don't he make me smile
He's never far away
Or too tired to say I want you

And I'm always a lady
Just like a lady should be
But when they turn out the lights
He's still my baby to me

And when we get behind closed doors
Then I let my hair hang down
Oh, he makes me glad I'm a woman
Oh, no one knows what goes on behind closed doors

Oh, behind closed doors
I let my hair hang down
I'm glad that I'm a woman
No one knows what goes on behind closed doors

Behind closed doors
I let my hair hang down
He makes me glad I'm a woman
No one knows what goes on behind closed doors

And when we get behind closed doors
Then I let my hair hang down
Last time I saw him
He sweetly kissed my lips
Last time I saw him
He said:"I'll be back for more of this"
Last time I saw him
We were crying at the bus
I knew he hated leaving
But he had to set us up

I gave him money
I know I invested well
Mamma doesn't trust him
But he loves me I can tell

Each time the greyhound
Arrives at nine o' clock
But I don't start my crying
'Till that last man's gotten off

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
But I'm still waiting here
Without a fear
That bus will someday turn around

I had no letter
It's been six months, maybe better
I try forgetting him
But I love him more then ever

I have decided
I've waited long enough
If there was nothing wrong
He would return right on that bus

There must be trouble
So I'm leavin' on the double
If he can't get to me
I know he needs me desperately

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine

Last time I saw him
Last time I saw my honey
Last time I saw him
He was greyhound-bound
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine

La de da, la da do
Do la da da, da da da

Last time I saw him
He was looking fine
And as he waved goodbye
He said don't cry
I'm coming back, no rain or shine
Darlin'...
You know you've got the cruelest streak
You only say you love just to
Keep me weak
Your loving words have kept me here for
Many years
I'm leavin...I'll face the tears
You know that

No-one's gonna be a fool forever
Ain't no-one gonna be a fool for life
No-one's gonna be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye

Beautiful plans are hard to forget
You promised me a family
A little girl with braids skipping
Off to school
A part of you and me will never be
You know that

No-one's gonna be a fool forever
Ain't no-one gonna be a fool for life
No-one's gonna be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye

No-one's gona be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye

Darlin
I'm leaving you, but with regrets
Everything I have for you is gone
There's nothing left
You had me apologize for things
I didn't do
To keep my self-respect
I'm leaving you
You know that

No-one's gonna be a fool forever
Ain't no-one gonna be a fool for life
No-one's gonna be a fool forever
This fool is gonna say goodbye
Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Hey, the touch of your hands
Awakens feelings deep inside me
You know
The warmth of your breath
Is like a soft wind sent to guide me
All those sweet sensations
Let me feel them now

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Oh, we're starting together
I feel your love is flowing through me
You know
Whatever you're doing
I love the way
You do it to me
All those sweet sensations
Let me feel them now
Ooh

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Ooh
I see the love on your face is glowing
I feel your lovin' inside me growin'
I know exactly just where you're goin'
Let me come with you

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too

Love me the way that you love me
The way that you do when you're dreaming of me
Love me the way that you love me
Give me the pleasure that makes me love you too
Johnny's been runnin' hard all his life
'Cause life never treated him right
Well he ain't running now
You see his eyes are closed
They can't hurt him tonight

Sleepin', he's sleepin'
Just let him be for a while
Don't wake him, don't take him
To where the people don't smile

Sleepin', my man is sleepin' nice now
Please let him stay here with me
I promise, I'll keep him
At home, where he's supposed to be

He's been out there
In the streets you know
And strugglin', scufflin'
Trying to survive
Out there in a richman's world
And now you say my Johnny is not alive
But you're wrong, can't you see

Sleepin', he's just sleepin' mister
He doesn't rest very much
He lives hard and he gives hard
And I'll just die for his touch

Sleepin', he's sleepin'
Without a care to his name
He's peaceful
He's quiet
He's tired of runnin' his game

He's been out there
In the streets you know
With all the pain and all the suffering
Out there
Where you fight like hell
He never learned a fix don't fix a thing
Don't touch him

Johnny put too much in his vanes
And now you're trying to tell me he's gone
I don't believe you
I'm just gonna sit here
And rock him in my arms

Sleepin', he's sleepin'
He doesn't rest very much
You see he lives hard and gives hard

Remember me
A face you used to see
Not the same song that I used to be
I had their words passing through me
But I just can't find the rhymes
I've been every place but right so many times

When will I come home to you
Whenever you want me to
It's a cold and lonely world
When you're not loving me

Your world is my only one
I'm back where I started from

In 1925 she stole the show
But that was many, many years ago
Abandoned in a pile of useless junk
I found her never to be lost again
While I'm around her
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old funky clothes
We don't care if folks are laughing
When we're on the road
Can't you feel that surge of power
Going 18 miles an hour
I could ride forever in my old funky rolls
She ain't even paid for but she's mine I suppose
Once they tried to repossess her
But she wouldn't start
God bless her
Spunky hunk a junk my funky rolls
For 30 years she got by on her looks
That was chic, that was very chic
Her face appeared in all the motor books

Once a week each and every week
When they checked her gasket out
The old girl blew it
Funky was a lemon
She never knew it
But I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
She's got Plymouth headlights and
A tank full of holes
Once I thought I really lost her on Cid Boulevard
Funky found the love she needed
Metaphor, overheated
I could ride forever in my old funky, my old funky rolls
Just give me a bad hat and some old, old funky clothes
There goes the radiator
Break me up, I'll see you later
Spunky hunk a junk my funky
My funky rolls
Rickitick and teak my honey
Wackitack, hack, she's a honey
Funky hunk a junk
My funky rolls
Come on funky, will you please start?
Funky, I'll kick your ass
Funky, would you please start?
Funky, here comes the man from the finance company
That's a nice car
Nice, Funky
I'll see you later!
My funky, my funky rolls
Last time I saw him

Where did we go wrong
I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong
How could life give us love, then take it away

Alone again today
Remembering when

We were a brand new morning
We weren't afraid to feel
All that we asked was somewhere to hide

We were like happy children
Reaching out to touch everything that's real
We believed in love 'cause our lives were touching inside

And baby, remember the things we needed
The summers and the winters and springs we needed
The feeling we would fly and on wings we needed to share

Remember the people how few we needed
We always had the me and the you we needed
If every little thing that we knew we needed to care was there

Then where did we go wrong
And isn't time supposed to heal me?
Where did we go wrong
And can a part of you still feel me
As much as yesterday
A touch a world away
We were the time of Crystal
Shining for love to see
Both of us gave the things we receive

We were like hungry people
As I gave to you so you gave to me
Believing in our love 'cause we love the things we believe

Baby, remember the dreams we needed
The nights we couldn't sleep and these dreams we needed
So we could find the time for what it seems we needed to say

Remember the touches to show we needed
To keep our love and keep our love the glow we needed
And being here without you I know we needed to stay
That way

But where did we go wrong
I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong
How could life give us love, then take it away

Where did we go wrong
I thought that we were supposed to make it
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go wrong
Where did we go wrong
Well early in the morning, about the break of day
I ask the Lord, "Help me find the way!"
Help me find the way to the promised land
This lonely body needs a helping hand
I ask the Lord to help me please find the way

When the new day's a dawning, I bow my head in prayer
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me there?"
Won't you guide me safely to the Golden Stair?
Won't you let this body your burden share?
I pray to the Lord, "Won't you lead me please, lead me there?"
When the judgment comes to find the world in shame
When the trumpet blows won't you call my name?
When the thunder rolls and the heavens rain
When the sun turns black, never shine again
When the trumpet blows, won't you call me please, call my name!
If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
A hundred miles, a hundred miles
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Five hundred miles, five hundred miles
Lord, I'm five hundred miles from my home

Not a shirt on my back, not a penny to my name
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way
This a-away, this a-way, this a-way, this a-way
Lord, I can't go a-home this a-way

If you miss the train I'm on, you will know that I am gone
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
I am a man of constant sorrow;
I've seen trouble all my day
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised

All through this world, I'm bound to ramble
Through storm and wind, through sleet and rain
I'm bound to ride that northern railroad
Perhaps I'll take the very next train

Your friends they say I am a stranger
You'll never see my face no more
There is just one promise that's given
We'll sail on God's Golden Shore

I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my day
I'm going back to California
Place where I was partly raised
This train don't carry no gamblers, this train
This train don't carry no gamblers, this train
This train don't carry no gamblers

This train don't carry no gamblers, this train

This train, don't carry no jokers, well, this train
This train, don't carry no jokers, well, this train
This train, don't carry no jokers
No high-tone women, no cigar smokers, well
This train, don't carry no jokers, well, this train

This train, done carried my mother, well, this train
This train, done carried my mother, well, this train
This train, done carried my mother
My mother, my father, my sister and my brother
This train, done carried my mother, well this train

This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train
This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train
This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train
This train, she's bound for glory
If you want to get to heaven then you've got to be holy, well
This train, she's bound for glory, well, this train

It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring
Bumped his head and he went to bed
And he couldn't get up in the mornin'
Rain rain, go away, come again some other day

Now everybody hide and I'll be it!"
Star light, star bright
First star I see tonight
Wish I may, wish I might
Have the wish I wish tonight

Rain rain, go away, come again some other day

Won't be my father's Jack
No, I won't be my mother's Jill
I'll be a fiddler's wife and fiddle when I will

It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring
Bumped his head and he went to bed
And he couldn't get up in the mornin'
Rain rain, go away, come again some other day

Eighty-Five, Ninety.
Ninety-five, a Hundred

Anyone round my base is it!
Ready or not, here I come!

You read about Sampson, you read about his birth
He was the strongest man that ever lived on Earth
One day old Sampson was walking alone
He looked down on the ground and he saw an old jaw-bone
He lifted up that jaw-bone and he swung it over his head
And when he got to moving ten thousand was dead

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down

Sampson and the lion got in attack
Sampson he crawled up on the lion's back
You read about this lion - he killed a man with his paw
Sampson he got his hands around the lion's jaw
And he ripped that beast till the lion was dead
And the bees made honey in the lion's head

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had lovely looks, God knows, and coal black hair
Delilah she climbed up on Sampson's knee
And said "Tell me where your strength lies, if you please"
She talked so fine, she talked so fair
Sampson said "Delilah, cut off my hair
Shave my head just as clean as your hand
And my strength will be like a natural man."
If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down

If I had my way
If I had my way in this wicked world
If I had my way I would tear this building down
The Cruel War is raging, Johnny has to fight
I want to be with him from morning to night
I want to be with him, it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

Tomorrow is Sunday, Monday is the day
That your Captain will call you and you must obey
Your captain will call you it grieves my heart so
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

I'll tie back my hair, men's clothing I'll put on
I'll pass as your comrade, as we march along
I'll pass as your comrade, no one will ever know
Won't you let me go with you?
No, my love, no

Oh Johnny, oh Johnny, I fear you are unkind
I love you far better than all of mankind
I love you far better than words can e're express
Won't you let me go with you?
Yes, my love, yes

Yes, My Love, Yes
When I was just a lad of ten, my father said to me
"Come here and take a lesson from the lovely lemon tree."
"Don't put your faith in love, my boy", my father said to me
"I fear you'll find that love is like the lovely lemon tree."
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day beneath the lemon tree, my love and I did lie
A girl so sweet that when she smiled the stars rose in the sky
We passed that summer lost in love beneath the lemon tree
The music of her laughter hid my father's words from me:

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat

One day she left without a word.
She took away the sun
And in the dark she left behind, I knew what she had done
She'd left me for another, it's a common tale but true
A sadder man but wiser now I sing these words to you:

Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
Lemon tree very pretty and the lemon flower is sweet
But the fruit of the poor lemon is impossible to eat
If I had a hammer
I'd hammer in the morning
I'd hammer in the evening
All over this land
I'd hammer out the danger
I'd hammer out a warning
I'd hammer out the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a bell
I'd ring it in the morning
I'd ring it in the evening
All over this land
I'd ring out the danger
I'd ring out a warning
I'd ring out the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

If I had a song
I'd sing it in the morning
I'd sing it in the evening
All over this land
I sing about the danger
I'd sing out a warning
I'd sing out the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

Well I've got a hammer
And I've got a bell
And I've got a song to sing
All over this land
It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's a song about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land

It's the hammer of justice
It's the bell of freedom
It's a song about the love between my brothers and my sisters
All over this land
Oh once I had a little dog, his color it was brown
I taught him for to whistle, to sing and dance and run
His legs they were fourteen yards long, his ears so very wide
Around the world in half a day, upon him I could ride

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May

Oh once I had a little frog, he wore a vest of red
He'd lean upon his silver cane, a top hat on his head
He'd speak of far off places, of things to see and do
Of all the Kings and Queens he'd met while sailing in a shoe

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May

Oh once I had a flock of sheep, they grazed upon a feather
I'd keep them in a music box from wind or rainy weather
And every day the sun would shine, they'd fly all through the town
To bring me back some golden rings, candy by the pound

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May

Oh once I had a downey swan, she was so very frail
She sat upon an oyster shell and hatched me out a snail
The snail had changed into a bird, the bird to butterfly
And he who tells a bigger tale would have to tell a lie

Sing Tarry-O Day, Sing, Autumn to May
Where have all the flowers gone, long time passing?

[Intro: Kid Capri]
Hey, hey, hey
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, you better flee hops, or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if crack never came out
I got the wild style, always been a foul child
My guns go "BOOM BOOM!"
and yo' guns go "pow pow"
I'm known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin'
Front, and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques
I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies, buddy, don't make it thirty-six
Step to this, you're good as gone
Word is bond, I leave mics torn when I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, and onnn, and onnn!
C'mon, put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it on, represent, put it on, C'MON!
[Verse 2: Big L]
Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss, chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti
(You don't know?)
you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother, and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz, I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter, also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me?
Haha, you's a funny nigga
I flows, so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell you the truth, it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song, yo, it's a must that I put it on

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
Yeah, so put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella, put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L!
Put it on, represent!
Put it on, c'mon, put it on!
[Bridge: Patois Chatta]
Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy, you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead from a me you provoke

[Verse 3: Big L]
I drink Moët, not Beck's beer, I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean, I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You can't kill me, I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin', I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples, the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on, adiós, ghost, I'm gone

[Chorus: Kid Capri]
So put it on, Big L, put it on!
C'mon, put it onnn, big fella put it on and onnn!
Big L, you gotta put it on and on!
Put it on, Big L put it on ond on!
Word up, knahmsayin?
My man Big L, runnin' things for the nine-four
And nine-oh-s, you know what I mean?
It's the Kid Capri, in full flair
And we gon' put it on a little somethin' like this
Big L, c'mon!
[Outro: Big L (Kid Capri)]
Lord Finesse (He be puttin' it on)
My man Buckwild (He be puttin' it on and on)
My man Fat Joe (He be puttin' it on)
Showbiz and A.G. (Yeah, they be puttin' it on and on)
I can’t forget Diamond D (He be puttin' it on)
The whole D.I.T.C.
(Yeah, they be puttin' it on and on)
And of course Kid Capri (Yeah, I be puttin' it on)
The whole N.Y.C.
(Yeah, we be puttin' it on and on)
And I’m out
[Verse 1]
Ayo, spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight, friend?
A'ight, then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah 'cause I got all of them sprung, Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them, they come back
I'm coming straight out the N.Y.C
I'm down with Diggin In The Crates and I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Verse 2]
Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance, Jack, to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Verse 3]
Battles, I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill)
I'm coming straight out the NYC
Rap's my J-O-B, and I'm MVP

[Hook]
If rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
Yo if rap was a game I'll be M.V.P
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
[Verse 1: Big L]
Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick, mad chicks be on a brother's tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
All the ho's gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear, long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losing all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and out of luck
Then she takes off and breaks off, your ho's gone, so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Verse 2: Big L]
Girls of the nineties ain't nothing but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leaving brothers for the next man 'cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer, not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz, they'll be your best friends
Yeah, as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours, but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go, now you solo
But when you was makin' papes selling jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was taking 'em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke, the girls stopped speaking
'Cause nowadays girls want you to trip
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big...
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Verse 3: Big L]
I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money hungry girl a.k.a.
gold digger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss, but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz, I'ma break it down like this

[Chorus: Showbiz]
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots
If you don't got ends, you won't be getting no skins
And if you don't got money, you won't scoop a honey
If you don't got cash, you won't be getting no ass
And if you're not clocking loot you won't be knocking no boots

[Outro]
It's like that y'all and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all, I'm living swell, y'all
I do my thing, that's why my name ring bells, y'all
If you don't got ends, girls be fronting
If you don't got ends, they ain't giving up nothing
If you don't got ends, all the girls ignore you
If you don't got ends, they act like they never saw you
If you don't got ends
[Intro: Big L]
Yo, my crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

[Verse 1: Big L]
Aiyo, folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin' this kid is a joke?
I put chumps to rest fast, when my Smith-Wes' blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules, I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed, I got a short fuse
I go berserk when I put in work or do dirt, jerk
So stay alert, no smirk, 'cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley, not the valley
I'm hotter than Cali, wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally, I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios, ghost, I'm 5 thous'

[Verse 2: Terra]
Well, I'm flave, and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved, yo, 'cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In '87 I sold cracks, collected some dough stacks
Hold gats, a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated, rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it, his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter, sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother, I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare, the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck, Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck, niggas gotten props to swallow nuts

[Verse 3: Herb McGruff]
For those that don't know, yo, I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff and when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise
Break bones, then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live, but I'm mad liver
Aiyo, my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease, ate up like rice and peas
(Herb, can you fight?)
Yo, I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit, I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L, straight from Hell, I'm the fuck up outta here

[Verse 4: Buddah Bless]
Aiyo, it's time to get drastic, but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it, now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood, I'm servin' brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
'Cause I'm no maricón, for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice, I'm mad nice
Aiyo, I'm quick to lick the mag twice and cold take a fag's life
My swellin' melon got niggas jealin'
Aiyo, fuck bribes, I'm takin' niggas lives like a felon

[Verse 5: Big Twan]
Yo, I'm bustin' chumps like a Glock 10
When I drops in, the top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow, don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow, when I rhyme I just kill your show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
No frail, kids get nailed and read braille when they fail, dig
Yeah, and I'm nasty, too nasty to trash me, bash me
Aiyo, that's dead, so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft, I gotta pump that's sawed-off
But when I let slugs out, you will get rubbed out
You dissin', you'll come up missin' like a cub scout

[Verse 6: Killa Kam - Cam'Ron]
Rappers be funny like Fletch
'Cause they sections say they slaughter, son
Talk about nines and TECs, and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam, I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it, a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease 'cause once I release
My crew from the East, we leavin' at least 20 police deceased
It's the beast on attack, so make tracks, I break backs
I jack with def gats and black MACs
On Lenox Ave., ain't no light looks, you fight crooks
Left and right hooks, if you front, get your life took

[Verse 7: Trooper J]
I'm havin' nail-sharp pains in my brain like a Hellraiser
I'm blazin' trails from jail cells, so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin' but lead
Boom-bye-bye, dem find another batty bwoy dead
In backyard alleys, but I call 'em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein' heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up, and keep my head straight

[Verse 8: Mike Boogie]
I should never rhyme 'cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes, poppin' bones
And sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God, it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're comin' to see me, nigga, bring a cast and crutches
And niggas, I don't need a gun for you, none of you
'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their motherfuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice 'cause it's a fact, friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a MAC-10
And niggas ain't half as nice, so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife, they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm 'bout to skate in a rush, just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L, aiyo, 8 is enough

[Outro: Big L]
True, true and before I get up outta here
I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
What's up to Rock-N-Will from the Hard Pack Crew
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O.
Crew
The Best Out Crew, the M&M Crew
And all the other crews that's representin' in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin?
And last but not least
I gotta say peace to the 139th Street NFL Crew
My crew, word up
[Verse 1]
Yo, once again, it's the Big L, that kid who got much props
From killin' corrupt cops with motherfuckin' buck shots
So don't step to this, 'cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big, but they make coffins yo' size, too
I was taught wise, I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Cali, it's Harlem nigga, we do walk-by's
No one can match me, tax me, or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps, G, just ask me
Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good, that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out, I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out, then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin?
That's idiotic
Cause if Big L got the AIDS, every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than Swiss cheese

[Chorus]
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

[Verse 2]
I steal lives like a stone thief, so leave me alone, chief
Or catch a buck shot to your dome piece
I must warn, I got it goin' on, word is bond
Ducks be gettin' thrown off platforms like PM Dawn
I'm catchin' bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers, not just on niggas, but hoes too
So don't try to test me, 'cause I can't stand testers
Fuck around, I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears, pal
But man, you've been rappin' for years now
And ain't made a hit yet, you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews, I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin' motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the get-go
Leavin' fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

[Chorus]
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

[Verse 3]
Yo, ever since I was young, I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit 'em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name, I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin' snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS, then I'ma start rapin' bitches
I'm all about makin' papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past, stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole
So the next day, knocked on his door, and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on, word is bond
Got it goin' on, from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style, I'm wild, comin' straight out of Harlem, pal
It's Big L, the motherfucking problem child

[Chorus]
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black
(Ducks better scat when the gat goes click-clack)
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

[Outro]
This goes out to all y'all bitch-ass niggas!
So if your mother ain't ready for a funeral, don't fuck with me!
'Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I ain't talkin' bout a reunion, motherfucker!
Yo, I'm bout to sign out, but before I go
I gotta say peace to the NFL crew, you know who you are
And all y'all niggas talkin' that gun shit and won't bust a rhyme, stop fakin' the funk!
Word, I'm bout to get up out of here
Yo I'm out B, yo peace man
I gotta get this money
So all y'all niggas on my hit list get your suits ready
Hahahaha!
[Intro: Malcolm X]
"Stealing runs rampant in Harlem, gambling runs rampant in Harlem—all types of evils and vices that tear apart our community run rampant in Harlem."
[Verse 1: Big L]
The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin' poems to have them faggots
Diggin' hoes like Reverend Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps 'til they head splits
Then break 'em like bread sticks
I sex chicks, I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' TEC's, because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln, left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well, Big L's gonna burn in Hell
Front and get scarred 'cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a heathen squad, and none of us believe in God

[Hook: McGruff + Big L]
(McGruff:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lenox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lenox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

[Verse 2: Big L]
I got styles you can't copy, bitch
It's the triple six in the mix, straight from H-E-double-hockey sticks
Every Sunday, a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito, we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute, my style switches up
They said a real man won't hit a girl
Well, I ain't real, 'cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill, L got nerves of steel
I'm cool, but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price
I'm the type to snap in Heaven with a MAC-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed, 'cause Hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit strictly
Little kids be wakin' up cryin'
Yellin', "Mommy, Big L is comin' to get me!"
[Hook: McGruff + Big L]
(McGruff:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lenox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lenox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own

[Verse 3: Big L]
I keep a cutie with a soft booty
Hoes be runnin' up, "Can I get your autograph, L?"
No, bitch, I'm off duty
I'm breakin' hottie hearts, niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge, just body parts
I keep the gear fresh, I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers, bitch – if I get AIDS, fuck it!
A beef with me, you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented, and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold-slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob, with no prob'
Ayo, crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread, pretzelhead
'Fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

[Hook: McGruff + Big L]
(McGruff:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lenox is the Danger Zone
(Big L:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
(Big L:) 'Cause one-three-nine and Lenox is the Danger Zone
(McGruff:) Where no man can withstand or hold his own
[Intro]
Yeah, it's the Big L
Coming at you once again, in nine-five
And I dedicate this one
To all my peoples from Uptown, and everywhere
Check it

[Verse 1]
Yo, where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
'Cause mad clowns be catchin' wreck with a Tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends, they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school, they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners, actin' stupid, gettin' lifted
Their life is twisted, and most of them are quite gifted
In other words, they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks, and bust gats, and run the streets actin' violent
To them, it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a (What?)
'cause they're street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

[Verse 2]
Before the rap contract, I was sellin' crack
Stay strapped with a Mac, I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this, I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain, go 'head, do your thing
But with the cash profit, make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot, own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars?
And yo, it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers for some fast money
They could've been boxers, ballplayers, or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo, they used to be legit kids, now they corrupt
They had dreams, but gave 'em up 'cause they street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

[Verse 3]
I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time, I'm in the crib writing rhymes to some dope beats
Or either calling up some freaks to bone
But word up, I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid, in other words, it's spooky
The streets be callin' me, like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke, listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from, you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners, that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck

[Chorus]
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
You better listen when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time
So pay attention when L rhyme
'Cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

[Outro]
Word up
Ayo take it from me, the Big L
'Cause I been through it all, you know what I'm sayin'?
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the casualties of the streets
I'm outta here
[Intro]
It's the number one crew in the area

[Verse 1: Big L]
The Big L be lightin' niggas like incense
Gettin' men lynched, and when tensed, I'm killin' infants for ten cents
'Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears, I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares?
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
A TEC-9 is my utensil
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada
'Cause Big L be fuckin' with more keys than a janitor

[Verse 2: Lord Finesse]
Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' Now & Laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me 'cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

[Hook]
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MC's to the graveyard"
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MC's to the graveyard"

[Verse 3: Microphone Nut]
Yo, I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool, ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac clack clack motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
'Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From 25 consecutive 25 to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Wreck like Das EFX straight out the fuckin' sewer
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
The way I rock no way you could stop
I stop, pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
'Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
Pound for p-p-pound the best around
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel 'cause I'm real
Ya man get outta line and it's kill kill kill kill

[Hook]
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MC's to the graveyard"
It's the number one crew in the area
"Known for sendin' garbage MC's to the graveyard"

[Verse 5: Party Arty of Ghetto Dwellaz]
Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself 'cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal, eatin' people
Not Jeffrey Dahmer I'm the sequel, head or gut like Illegal
So what'cha want?
Yo I'm strapped with the gats step up plap plap
I'm leavin' caps in your back fool
I rip tracks wanna say peace to Hip Hop
A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I tell em' big up big up it's a stick up stick up
I stick and move

[Big L]
And that's how we do.
So I.U.
grab the gat and let loose

[Verse 6: Grand Daddy I.U.]
Yo, rat-tat-tat I got the gat cocked
Nigga we ghost man a punk?
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the west is
Fuck suggestions
I'll blow out a niggas intestines
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never passed up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops?
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
'Cause you're marked for death
[Intro]
(Everybody everywhere is scratching for what they can get
Did you think anybody in this town is any different?
They don't give a damn who gets killed
Just as long as "the dice keep rollin
The hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowin")

[Verse]
My name is L, and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
On 139 and Lenox Ave. there's a big park
And if you're soft, don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats
That's why I carry gats
Yo, I'm a muthafuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city, shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough 50/50
One day we stuck a dice game on the ave. and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those, you don't need no muthafuckin' friends
If I catch you on a late night, black, you're getting stuck, jack
My moms told me to get a job, fuck that
Ayo, picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob, selling corn on the cob
Yo, how the hell I'mma make ends meet
Making about 120 dollars a week
Man, I'd rather do another hit
I want clean clothes, mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo, I admit, I'm a sucker
A low down, dirty, sneaky, double-crossin' connivin' muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I wasn't poor, I was po' - I couldn't afford the 'o-r'
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip, I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja, dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds, then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene, took his brand new ring
'Cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him, "Give up the dough, before you get smoked
Oh you're broke?
*gunshots*
Now you're dead broke"
The Big L was cold crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care, I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck, 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless, some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous

[Outro]
Word
All of us from Harlem
139
That's living the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
KnawhatImsayin?
This goes out
To my brothers
Big Lee and Don Ice
Reggie Reg, T.C., Todd, Lou, Black Tone
Whitey, Ty Speeder, Ru Dog, Herb McGruff
E-Jet, G Love, Doc Ring, Slice and Rich Dice
I can't forget the 1-4-0, Lennox Ave. crew
And I gotta say rest in peace to Mate the Skate, Dog
And my man Kerry, peace

Now what kinda life is that for a child?
Now what kinda life is that for a child?
Now what kinda life is that for a child?
Now what kinda life is that for a fucking child?
Word to mother, fuck all that stupid shit
Controversial, not commercial, nigga
[Verse 1]
There are too many MC's who are overrated
You ask me, they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz, they don't know what rap is
So give it up, become a actor or a actress
Or a producer, 'cause you fail to use the
Mic right, so take flight 'fore I bruise ya
For sayin' those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked, sit back and rip that contract
Aiyo, I'm serious, Big L ain't playin' games
I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin' names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par, you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin' platinum and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin' down
Because it should be the other way around

[Hook]
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted

[Verse 2]
MC's - what's goin on?
I don't understand, man, how rappers cold transform
One minute you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for, but not no more
You changed, you rearranged, you're not the same
Your raps are plain, that explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top, then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop, now you no longer gain props
Who's fault is that?
Nobody's but your own, black
Used to make fat tracks, jack, but now you're stone wack
So MC's, don't ever step out your range
Remain the same, and only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin' for mine
But if you're rough, stay rough, if you're dap, stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains, and now they're wearin' beads?
[Hook]
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted

[Verse 3]
This is how it should be done
I'm not the one, and my raps is strong like rum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb
Plus slum (How come?)
Rap skills they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail, they're false like fairy tales
Your technique and everything you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name, but your lyrics are lame, black
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Your raps border wack, and you went on tour with that
Crap, don't understand it, 'cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul than Nike Airs, givin' MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin' hard, and rhymes they don't write theirs
But still call themselves MC's?
Please, how could that be?
[Hook]
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
I don't understand it (I don't understand it)
How MC's take this rap game for granted
[Verse 1]
Yo, on the scene is the brother that's big, I'm not a little kid
I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin pig
Cause to me they ain't nothin but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the .38s cocked, 2 deep, up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life, he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights, and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop, or I'mma stop em, by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me, muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin life bids
Cause justice means 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip, cause I'm fed up with that bullshit

[Hook]
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up (Aw, shit)

[Verse 2]
Whether it's the hot, warm, cool or the cold season
Pigs be fuckin with a nigga for no reason
You're just gettin home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fuckin jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up
Then get roughed up, and that's fucked up
This every day, not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin the other cheek
Or you'll be layin' in a pine box
Bad enough they got .38s, now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm also fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down, then they see your skin is brown, then they keep goin
Cause I wasn't white, the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip, the trigger I pull quick
Cause I'm fed up with that bullshit

[Hook]
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up with that bullshit (bullshit)
I'm fed up (Aw, shit)
[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, I'm serious, I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black, never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze, I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet, my lyrics are well-writ
You sayin', "L's this," and, "L's that"—get off L' dick
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
And we do drivebys in 325is
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican, I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up, give me two thumbs up

[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)

[Verse 2: Big L]
I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
It's all about me, yo it's a B. I. G. L thing
The crown is still mine cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate, Big L practice Gun Fu
Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MC's be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing, cause every hero got a theme song

[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)

[Verse 3: Big L]
The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact, black, I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride, I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last, I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass (boom)
I make a lot of dough, I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate, she gotta go!
When I was young I played with guns, not a kiddy toy
Cause I'm a rough, rugged gangsta, not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike, but Mike wanna be like L

[Hook]
Settin' it off lettin' it off (whatever) (x4)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Give it to 'em L) Yeah (x3)
(Let 'em have it L) What?
(Let 'em have it)

Outro [Ma$e]:
A-yo, big shots to all them niggas on the corner
Doin' something they ain't
Got no business doin'
I gotta say what's up to S&S, Doo Wop, and the Bounce Squad
Can't forget my peeps from Brooklyn, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like Box and Herb and Big Sid
A-yo, L, you must be buggin', B
You didn't even let me say what's up to my hoes, B

[Big L]
Oh yeah, we gotta say what's up to the hoes, man

Word up let's go see our P.O
[Big L answering machine message]
Ayo, what's up, this is Big L, know'm'sayin'
Calling you to see how that joint, you know'm'sayin', came out

[Intro: Miss Jones & Biz Markie sample]
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L

[Verse 1: Big L]
Ayo, spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl, I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend?
A'ight, then
L's a clever threat, a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah cause I got all of them sprung, Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw 'em they come back
I'm coming straight out the NYC
I'm down with Diggin' In The Crates and I'm MVP

[Chorus: Miss Jones & Indo]
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Verse 2: Big L]
Yo, it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku, mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad 'cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And every time I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the NYC
Peace to the Kid Capri, I'm MVP

[Chorus: Miss Jones & Indo]
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Bridge: Miss Jones & Biz Markie sample]
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L

[Verse 3: Big L]
Battles, I lose none, I make crews run
I get fools done, got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly, leave you smelly, then take your Pelle Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper, punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev, I got nothing but love for you, honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my (chill)
I'm coming straight out the NYC
Rap's my J-O-B, and I'm MVP

[Chorus: Miss Jones & Indo]
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP
The most valuable poet on the M.I.C

[Bridge: Miss Jones & Biz Markie sample]
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L
I'd like to introduce myself
It's Big L
I'd like to introduce myself

[Outro: Miss Jones]
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP
If rap was a game he'd be MVP
I said if rap was a game he'd be MVP

[Chorus]
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

[Big L]
Ayyo, one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel, yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib, yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came, but one problem, she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean, cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin, watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes, tryin to get the puss'
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
Cause my dick, is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said, "I hope you ain't tryin to dick tease
Ayyo, cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave."
Ayyo my game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
I caught a cab, on 139 & Lenox
Ayyo, I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo, I'mma kill that bitch, the next time that I see her

[Chorus] x2
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system, lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max, and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank, she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I said, "Sweeheart whats your name?"
"I gotta man," "I ain't ask you that."
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch, I said, "Fuck you bitch."
Another girl walked by, I called her
"Excuse me what's your name" "Lorraine, what's yours"
Ayyo, game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont, but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
She said, "L's for Lamont, but what's the Big for?"
"You'll see."
Ayyo, my pockets was extra thick
"So what you doin later, oh nothing, then lets catch a flick."
Yeah, I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M, movies, meal, and motel
And when it comes to this I'm a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her, undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting bolder
Cause I didn't put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a leak
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick

[Chorus] x4
I shoulda used a rubber, before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

Ayyo L these bitches be burnin’ the dog shit outta niggas, know what I’m sayin’?
Who you tellin’ man?
These bitches nowadays’d have a nigga dick drippin’ lava

[Laughter.]
You know what I’m sayin’?
Ayyo, these bitches’ll have a nigga, give a nigga’s balls a heat rash or somethin’ man

Okay…

Man fuckin’ with these hoes without a rubber nowadays is like bungee jumpin’ with a rope around your neck.
That’s like playin’, [laughter], that’s like playin’ Russian roulette with a shotgun.
Ayyo word, ayyo, ayyo man, fuck a rubber man, I’m a start puttin’ balloons on my dick, dog, ayyo I’m a start puttin’ suntan lotion on my dick or somethin’.
Ayyo these bitches is triflin’ dog.
Ay I’m gettin’ the fuck up out of here man

Aight, let’s bounce

Aight
Lovin’, tender sweeet as i remember
Feelin’ fires in your arms
Say we’ll last forever
Wonderful together

Huggin, squeezing
More than merely pleasing
Soothing, moving
In my heart

There are no others
No one is sweeter
I’m in a trance going deeper deeper
High as a rainbow
There’s only you me and how you make me feel

Just us – just us –just us

Livin’ easy, feeling mighty freely
Givin’ true my whole life through
Secret dreams unfoldin’
Reachin’ touchin’ holdin’
Laughin’, there is more than i can hope for
Livin’ lovin’ in your arms

There are no other loves
Deeper and deeper oh
I’m as high as a rainbow
[Verse 1]
You can dance
Every dance with the one who gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that holds your hand
In the pale moonlight

[Chorus]
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me

[Verse 2]
Oh, I know
That the music's fine like sparklin' wine
Go and have your fun
Laugh and sing
But while we're apart
Don't give your heart to anyone

[Chorus]
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me

[Verse 3]
Baby, don't you know I love you so?
Can't you feel it when we touch?
I will never ever let you go
I love you  oh so much

You can dance
Go and carry on 'til the night is gone
'Til it's time to go
If she asks if you're all alone
Can she take you home?
You got to tell her no

[Chorus]
And don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me

[Chorus]
Just don't forget who's takin' you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me
Ooh darlin', save the last dance for me

[Verse 4]
You can dance
Every dance with the one that gives you the eye
Let him hold you tight
You can smile
Every smile for the one that holds your hand
In the pale moonlight

[Chorus]
Just don't forget who's taking you home
And in whose arms you're gonna be
So darlin', save the last dance for me

Ooh darlin', save the last dance for me
Save the last dance for me
Dance, dance, dance, dance
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I find it very very easy to be true
I find myself alone when each day's through
Yes I admit it, I am a fool for you
Because you're mine, I walk the line

As sure as night is dark and day is light
I keep you on my mind both day and night
And happiness I've known proves that it's right
Because you're mine, I walk the line

You've got a way to keep me on your side
You give me cause for love that I can't hide
For you, I know I'd even try to turn the tide
Because you're mine, I walk that line

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine
I keep my eyes wide open all the time
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line
Because you're mine, I walk the line

I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk that line
I'm gonna walk it
Because you're mine
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk that line
I'm gonna walk it, walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
Walk it, walk it
You know I'm gonna walk it
I'm gonna walk the line
Because you're mine
I'm gonna walk the line
I'm gonna walk the line
[Chorus]
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven

[Verse 1]
A time to be born, a time to die
A time to plant, a time to reap
A time to kill, a time to heal
A time to laugh, a time to weep

[Chorus]
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven

[Verse 2]
A time to build up, a time to break down
A time to dance, a time to mourn
A time to cast away stones
A time to gather stones together

[Chorus]
To everything
Turn, turn, turn
There is a season
Turn, turn, turn
And a time to every purpose under Heaven

[Verse 3]
A time of love, a time of hate
A time of war, a time of peace
A time you may embrace
A time to refrain from embraces

[Verse 4]
A time to gain, a time to lose
A time to rend, a time to sow
A time to love, a time to hate
A time for peace, I swear it's not too late
When you're alone and life is making you lonely
You can always go downtown
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry
Seems to help, I know, downtown

Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city
Linger on the sidewalks where the neon signs are pretty
How can you lose?
The lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
No finer place for sure, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Don't hang around and let your problems surround you
There are movie shows downtown
Or maybe you know some little places to go
To where they never close, downtown

Just listen to the rhythm of the music that they're playing
Making conversation while you're on the dance floor swaying
Happy again, the lights are much brighter there
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares

And go downtown
Where all the lights are bright, downtown
Waiting for you tonight, downtown
You're gonna be alright now

And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to
Guide them along, so maybe I'll see you there
You can forget all your troubles, just forget all your cares

And go downtown
Things'll be great when you're downtown
Don't wait a minute more, downtown
Everything's waiting for you

Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown

Downtown, where all the lights are bright
Downtown, waiting for you tonight
Downtown, you're going to be alright now
Get on, get on, get on downtown
[Verse 1]
I can hear the wind a-blowing in my mind
The same way it used to sound through the Georgia pines
And you were always there to answer when I'd call
You and me, we had it all

[Verse 2]
I remember how you used to touch my hair
Reaching for a feeling that was always there
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
Yeah you and me, we had it all

[Chorus]
I know that we can never live those times again
So I let these dreams take me back to where we've been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can
Oh it was so good, it was so good
It was so good when you were my man

[Verse 3]
But I'll never stop believing in your smile
Even though you didn't stay, it was still worthwhile
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
Oh baby, didn't we, didn't we just have it all?
[Chorus]
I know that we can never get that far again
So I let my memory take me on back to where we'd been
And I stay there with you just as long as I can
It was so good, it really was, it was so good
It was so good when you were my man

[Outro]
You were the best thing in my life I can recall
Baby baby baby, you and me, we had it all
She don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did, she wouldn't break your heart
No she don't love you like I love you
She's trying to tear us apart

Fare thee well, I know you're leaving
For the new love that you've found
That pretty girl that you've been dating
Oh I've got a feeling she's gonna put you down

'Cause she don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did, she wouldn't break your heart
No she don't love you like I love you
She's trying to tear us apart

She uses all the great quotations
She says all the things I wish I could say
But she's had so many rehearsals
To her, it's just a lover's play

But wait, when the final act is over
And you're left standing all alone
When she takes her bow and makes her exit
Oh well I'll be there to take you home

She don't love you like I love you
'Cause if she did, she wouldn't break your heart
She don't love you like I love you
She's trying to tear us apart
[Chorus]
We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way

[Verse 1]
I will never love you
The cost of love's too dear
But though I'll never love you
I'll live with you one year

[Chorus]
We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way

[Verse 2]
I'll sing to you each morning
I'll kiss you every night
But darling, don't cling to me
I'll soon be out of sight

[Chorus]
We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way

[Verse 3]
My daddy he once told me
Hey, don't you love you any man
Just take what they can give you
And give but what you can

[Chorus]
We'll sing in the sunshine
We'll laugh every day
We'll sing in the sunshine
And I'll be on my way

[Verse 4]
And when our year has ended
And I have gone away
I'll often speak about you
And this is what I'll say

[Verse 5]
You know we sang in the sunshine
We laughed every day
We sang in the sunshine
Then I went on my way
[Verse 1]
Oh sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

[Verse 2]
In and out my life
You come and you go
Leaving just your picture behind
And I've kissed it a thousand times

[Verse 3]
When you snap your fingers or wink your eye
I come a running to you
Tied to you like a ball-and-chain
And there's nothing that I can do

Can't help myself
No, I can't help myself

[Verse 4]
Sugar pie, honey bunch
I'm weaker than a girl should be
I can't help myself
I'm a fool in love you see

[Verse 5]
I wanna tell you I don't love you
Tell you that we're through
And I've tried
But every time I see your face
I get all choked up inside

[Verse 6]
When I call your name
Boy it starts the flame
Burning in my heart
Tearing it all apart
No matter how I try
My love I cannot hide

[Verse 7]
Sugar pie, honey bunch
You now that I'm weak for you
I can't help myself
I love you and nobody else

[Verse 8]
Ooh sugar pie honey bunch
I'll do anything you ask me to
I can't help myself
I want you and nobody else

[Verse 9]
Sugar pie, honey bunch
You know that I love you
I can't help myself
No no no, I can't help myself
[Verse 1]
You might wake up some morning
To the sound of something moving past your window in the wind
And if you're quick enough to rise
You'll catch the fleeting glimpse of someone's fading shadow
Out on the new horizon
You may see the floating motion of a distant pair of wings
And if the sleep has left your ears
You might hear footsteps running through an open meadow

[Chorus]
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

[Verse 2]
You might have heard my footsteps
Echo softly in the distance through the canyons of your mind
I might have even called your name
As I ran searching after something to believe in
You might have seen me running
Through the long abandoned ruins of the dreams you left behind
If you remember something there
That glided past you followed close by heavy breathing

[Chorus]
Don't be concerned, it will not harm you
It's only me pursuing something I'm not sure of
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love

[Verse 3]
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
Across my dreams, with nets of wonder
I chase the bright elusive butterfly of love
[Verse 1]
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Pretending that I'm doing well
My need is such I pretend too much
I'm lonely but no one can tell

[Verse 2]
Oh-oh, yes I'm the great pretender
Adrift in a world of my own
I've played the game but to my real shame
You've left me to dream all alone

[Chorus]
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

[Verse 3]
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing my heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

[Chorus]
Too real is this feeling of make-believe
Too real when I feel what my heart can't conceal

[Verse 4]
Oh yes I'm the great pretender
Just laughing and gay like a clown
I seem to be what I'm not, you see
I'm wearing this old heart like a crown
Pretending that you're still around

[Outro]
But I know what I am
I am the great pretender
[Verse 1]
I wish you flowers, sunshine and smiles
I wish you children that grow to make you proud
I wish you pretty things to wear
Sweet things to smell

[Chorus]
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (Well)

[Verse 2]
I wish you good friends that always treat you fair
Wanna wish you ribbons to tie around your hair
I wish you truckloads of cheer and many happy years

[Chorus]
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (Well)

[Verse 3]
Wanna wish you freedom to do all the things you love
I wish you blessings and kindness from above
Wanna wish you sunlight through the clouds
Hope you laugh out loud

[Chorus]
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (Well)

[Outro]
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (Well)
Oh now, I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (Well)
Oh now, I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (I wish you well)
I wish you well (Well)
[Verse 1]
Looking at what I see
What does living mean to me
All that I can ever be is just a man

[Chorus]
And the most you can ever do is the best you can

[Verse 2]
Riding on the world go round
Being me and a what I am
And what I am, I'm just a man

[Chorus]
And the most you can ever do is the best you can

[Bridge]
And what I've found is mostly worth it all
The wisdom of the future is the past
In city brouges and wise old southern drawls
The words that say the most say things that last

[Verse 3]
Riding on the world go round
Being me and what I am
And what I am, I'm just a man

[Chorus]
And the most you can ever do is the best you can
And the most you can ever do is the best you can
And the most you can ever do is the best you can
[Verse 1]
I love the story in your love song
Building them castles in your mind
You come down here looking for a feeling
Someday I know you're gonna find
I wanna lay down now beside you
But first we ought to take some time

[Chorus]
Before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

[Verse 2]
I wanna feel good just like you do (Feel good)
I haven't loved in quite some time (Feel good)
I have some phases that I've been through
Where I've just loved and left behind
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty
I don't wanna be unkind

[Chorus]
But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind
I wanna make love to your mind
I wanna make love to your mind
Before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

[Verse 3]
I wanna feel good just like you do (Feel good)
I haven't loved in quite some time (Feel good)
Know I had some funny phases that I've been through
Where I've just loved and left behind
I'm just too tired of feeling guilty
I don't really wanna be unkind

[Chorus]
But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind (To your mind)

[Bridge]
To your mind
To your mind
To your mind
To your mind

[Verse 4]
I love the story in your love song, little girl
Building them castles in your mind, mmm
You come down here from somewhere looking for a feeling
Someday I know you're gonna find
See, I wanna lay down now beside you, oh oh (Lay down)
But first we ought to take some time (Time)

[Chorus]
But before I make love to your body
I wanna make love to your mind

[Outro]
(To your mind)
I wanna make love to your mind (To your mind)
I wanna make love to your mind (To your mind)
I wanna make love to your mind
To your mind, ooh yeah
To your mind
To your mind
[Verse]
And I've sat in the sunshine in summers of sadness
And lived through the winter when lonely was here
And I've gone through the motions of feeling for fear
That I never would find you, my dear
And I'm thankful to whoever made it all possible
For me to be with you while I lived
And spare you the grief if I passed on before you
And I don't think I'd live if you died before me
And I hope that the smell of these roses will follow you
On in the time when the roses are gone

[Outro]
I love you, Dawn
I love you, Dawn

That the girl is lonely (lonely)
And go together lonely (lonely)
Some flashy lonely, hold on (lonely)

Might be lonely for David, hold on (lonely)
Might be lonely for Larry (lonely)
Might be lonely for Dennis, hold on (lonely)
Might be lonely for George, ah ha ha (lonely)
My dear girl lonely for Lewis, ah ha (lonely)
Might be lonely for Harvey (lonely)

Ah but pretty little girl is lonely (lonely)

Well (lonely)
Well (lonely)
Well (lonely)
Pretty little girl is lonely (lonely)
Well she's sendin' ..., oh (lonely)
Oh pretty little girl is lonely, how (lonely)
[Verse 1]
Sometimes a song is funky
'Cause you feel that way
A song might be easy and melancholy on another day
Sometimes a song gets mean and evil 'cause it ain't goin' right
Sometimes a song just try to get nervous 'cause you might be uptight
Sometimes a song is tender
Sometimes a song is sad
Maybe that evening that you wrote this song that's all the feeling you had
Sometimes a song just feels real good and lays right there in the groove
Sometimes a song might make you just wanna get up and move
Sometimes a song is somethin', uh-huh, that you never forget
But you keep on thinking that you ain't wrote the song yet

[Chorus]
Ah, sometimes a song, sometimes a song
Sometimes a song, sometimes a song

[Verse 2]
Sometimes a song is funky (Song is funky)
'Cause you feel that way ('Cause you feel that way)
A song might be easy and melancholy on another day
Sometimes a song gets mean and evil 'cause it ain't goin' right
('Cause it ain't goin' right)
Sometimes a song just try to get nervous 'cause you might be uptight
Sometimes a song is tender (Tender, tender)
Sometimes a song is sad (Song is sad)
Maybe that evening that you wrote this song that's all the feeling you had
Sometimes a song just feels real good and lays right there in the groove
(Right there in the groove)
Sometimes a song might make you just wanna get up and move
(Get up and groove)
Sometimes a song is somethin', uh-huh, that you never forget
But you keep on thinking that you ain't wrote the song yet

[Chorus]
Ah, sometimes a song, sometimes a song
Sometimes a song, sometimes a song
[Verse 1]
I will lay around sometimes and show some sadness
For people whom I've known that now are gone
And I will smile to show you when I'm happy
And let you know when things are going wrong
I will try my best to be there when you need me
And give you strength when you need someone strong
And I'll sit and cry with you, my dear, if need be
And I'll paint your pretty picture with a song

[Chorus]
I will paint your pretty picture with a song
I will paint your pretty picture with a song
Tell you tales of life as I see it
And I'll paint your pretty picture with a song

[Verse 2]
I will try my best to be there when you need me
To give you strength when you need someone strong
And I'll sit and cry with you, my dear, if need be
And I'll paint your pretty picture with a song

[Chorus]
I will paint your pretty picture with a song
I will paint your pretty picture with a song
I'll tell you tales of life as I see it
And I'll paint your pretty picture with a song

[Outro]
I will paint your pretty picture with a song
I will paint your pretty picture with a song
Tell you tales of life as I see it
And I'll paint your pretty picture with a song
I will follow my dreams wherever
They take me
I will stand upon the mountain and look down upon the seashores
But I'll always remember
The family table
If I don't ever go there anymore
I will stand up when it seems
That my troubles might break me
I will listen even though I know I've
Heard it all before
But I'll always remember
The family table
If I don't ever go there anymore
[Verse 1]
Busy hanging curtains
Children in the way
Whoa, that's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay?
Better talk to Billy
His doggy died today
Whoa, that's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay?
[Chorus]
Don't you want to stay?
Whoa, don't you want to stay?
That's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay?
[Verse 2]
Sundays in the meadow
See the children play
Whoa, that's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay?
[Chorus]
Don't you want to stay?
Whoa, don't you want to stay?
That's what the future holds with me
Don't you want to stay?
[Outro]
Don't you wanna stay?
Don't you wanna stay?
Don't you wanna stay?
[Verse]
Hello like before
I'd never come here
If I'd known that you were here
I must admit though
That's it's nice to see you, dear
You look like you've been doing well

Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again, that's kiss and tell

Hello like before
I guess it's different
'Cause we know each other now
I guess I've always known
We'd meet again somehow
So then it might as well be now

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
Hello like before
I hope we've grown
'Cause we were only children then
For laughs I guess we both can say
'I knew you when'
But then again, that's kiss and tell

Hello like before
I guess it's different
'Cause we know each other now
I guess I've always known
We'd meet again somehow
So then it might as well be now
Somewhere
A lonely girl lies weeping
A lonely man tries sleeping
But he's getting nowhere

Sometime
It may be close to morning
She thought she heard him calling
But there's nobody there

And somehow, somehow
He knows he's got to try

To hold on
Somewhere she's crying for him
Hold on
Someday her smile will call him
Hold on
There's someone out there trying for him
Somehow
Sometime
Somewhere

Somewhere
Again she sleeps alone
He is reaching for the phone
But he's calling no one

Oh Sometime
She's dreaming of her lover
It really can't be over
We've only just begun

And somehow, somehow
I know I've go to try

To hold on
Somewhere she's crying for me
Hold on
Someday her smile will call me
Hold on
There's someone out there trying for me
Somehow
Sometime
Somewhere

Hold on
Hold on

Somehow
Sometime
Somewhere
Each time that I hold you, your eyes fill with fear
You can't lose control now, the price is too dear;
But love, I have heard you crying in the dark
And the tears on your pillow came bleeding, weeping from your heart;

Oh Sinner, you're losing all that you had
Your day is in pieces, your night has gone mad
And love cannot touch you, the search has no end
And the one you've forgotten was really your only friend...

Then your soul flies to Heaven
You reach out for me
But the door will not open
You've thrown away the key;
No the door will not open
You've thrown away the key...

Oh Stranger beware the life that you lead
Is filled with the warnings you can or will not read;
Your castle has fallen, it lies in the sand
I heard your voice calling, I thought I felt the brush of your hand...

Oh Gambler remember the love that you lend
Will never come back for the game has no ending;
The smiler is calling, your turn for the deal
And the aces keep falling with every spin of the wheel;

Then you gather your winnings
You're ready to leave
But the door will not open
You've thrown away the key
Oh there's no point in staying
So don't wait to see
For the door will not open
You've thrown away the key
When the angry sky, opens up its mouth
And lays down a belt of rain from the north to the south;
Close your windows and close all your doors
And pray for those men who fall upon rocky shores

And when the hungry road, points its finger at your heart
And says "Stranger follow me, I will show you where to start;"
Well don't make a move, to the left or the right, or them
Hounds are gonna get you, send you running, screaming through
The stormy night

And one windy night, a flickering light, caught the eye of
A passing angel as she was in flight; she came to the
Door, and there she saw a young soldier crying, as he
Lay dying from a wound of war

Then the angel of the Lord, took the form of a girl
And knelt by the boy and said "I will help you to that other world
Oh rest your weary soul, lay your head upon my shoulder
Press your trembling hand in mine until this night is over
For that Devil wants you, but you are a soldier, and with a
Friend by your side there's no need to hide until the fight is
Over..."
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night

So if you need help, on a windy night, be sure to leave a
Candle burning so a friend can see the light; there may be a
Stranger come looking for you, and it may be an angel of the
Lord come to bring you better news;
On a windy night...
Na na na na oh Lord on this windy night...
Oh hear me, hear me Lord, oh Lord on my windy night...
Oh Hear me Lord, oh Lord on my windy night
Good morning, Blue Rider, and how was your night?
Did you meet a nice woman, did she make you feel alright?
I heard you came in from the country, looking for a good time
You walked round the hot spots, and you met some good friends of mine

Oh Mojo, come here, give my friend a glass of wine, strange flavour
That's right, it's a new recipe of mine- c'mon

Pull up a chair, I want you to hear
Have no fear and I'll tell you what goes on here

I pick people up off the roadside, and lift them high in the sky
There's no sense in walking on the wrong side, you gotta live before you die
Anything that takes your fancy, you can have for free
Wine, women and dancing, but you've got to sell your soul to me
'Cos once you are in, you'll never get out from Sin City, Sin City

Good morning, Blue Rider, and how was your night?
Did you get the best deal from your body, did she make you feel alright?
Well she did 'cos she's my friend...
I pick people up off the roadside, and lift them high in the sky
There's no sense in walking on the wrong side, you gotta live before you die
Anything that takes your fancy, you can have for free
Wine, women and dancing, but you've got to sell your soul to me
'Cos once you are in, you'll never get out from Sin City, Sin City
A new moon is laughing up there in the sky, but
My love is crying and I'll tell you why...

Crisis and confusion when she came along
Followed by delusion when I found out that I was wrong
She said "Baby, we're cruising along on the crest of a wave,"
And I said "Maybe, but baby I'm losing, and the only wave is
Goodbye..."

'Cos just when I'm starting to burn with desire
My blood's getting hot and the flame's rising higher
She says "Goodnight"...
And leaves me on fire, and I'm so sorry my love
I gotta say goodbye, ooh, ooh

A new moon, a new tune, another song is coming soon
New moon, new day, another love is coming my way
She took my heart, and without a word she tore it apart, ooh
New moon, so bright, shine your light on me for the rest of the
Night...
Scenes of soft seduction, spinning through my head
Watching her deduction as I lay grinning on my bed
She said "Honey, it's so moving, I can almost see our wedding day,"
And I said "Funny, you'd better start grooving honey or the only move
Is away"...

And then she turned with that look in her eye
And I know that bad weather'll be here by and by
And sure enough, she started to cry, and I'm so sorry my love
I really gotta fly, ooh, ooh...

A new moon, a new tune, another song is coming soon
New moon, new day, another love is coming my way
She took my heart, and without a word she tore it apart, ooh
New moon, so bright ooh shine your light on me for the rest of the
Night...
New moon, new moon... oh, oh, new moon
Bye, bye, bye, new moon, bye, bye, new moon
Pass me the bottle, pass me the wine
Open your throttle, and I'll drive you right out of your mind
Watching the waves, watching the sky
I'm just a sitting down here by the riverside
Watching the world going by...

She said that she loved me and always be true
But she was high above me, there's only one thing to do
Bye baby baby bye bye little darling, and now she's flying blue
And I'm sitting down here by the riverside
Watching the world passing through...

Oh yea yea yea Ram bam bi doo ah... Ram bam bi doo ay..
Do you want to meet my sister, she's good for a drink or two
At forty-five smiles to the gallon she can watch the world floating
Through

Throw away your city clothes, throw away your suit
Bring out your city rose, bring the dogs and the cats in the boot, yea
Yea yea
You don't need no shoes, you won't feel the blues
When you're sitting down here by the riverside
Watching the world passing through...

Oh Ram bam bi doo ah... Ram bam bi doo ay...
Roll one for me brother, eighteen inches long
And we can lay down here by the riverside
Smoking and singing this song... oh yea

Ram bam bi doo ah... Ram bam bi doo ay...
Sitting down here by the riverside
Watching the world going by...
There was a lonesome cowboy, who rode his horse all day
At night he slept in the moonlight, till he heard that midnight
Train...

And then that lonesome cowboy, looked up at the stars in the sky
"I will leave my land and my horses, on that midnight train I will
Ride

To the city, far across the plains
To that city, on that midnight train, here it comes
Choo choo choo... on that midnight train"

And then that lonesome cowboy, stepped into a bar
A pretty girl slid over nice and easy, "Boy your money won't go far."
She took him outside to an alley, he got dragged into a fight
And a bullet sent him dying, and he cursed that moonless night

In that city, far across the plains
In that city, he could hear that midnight train, down the line;
Choo choo choo... he could hear that midnight train

And now that lonesome cowboy is lain beneath the clay
His horses they're still waiting, for he is gone away;

Now if you think the grass is greener on the far side of the hill
All you cowboys, take it easy, there's no grass there at all

In that city, far across the plains
In that city, you'd better miss that midnight train, here it comes
Choo choo choo... you'd better miss that midnight train
Choo choo choo... that train is coming for you
Where your love is, put your heart, guard these moments well
Where your dreams are, put your hopes, you know they will not fail you
When the sun rises in the morning, you will wake up and find her yawning
When the wind blows strong and cold, she'll be with you until you grow old
Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?
I would build a lovely house with satin green shutters, it would be lovely
The most lovely house in the world...
And I would sing a lovely song with you in my mind, and you in my eyes
The most lovely song in the world...
I would write it down on the wall, just for you, just for you;
And I would hold you in my arms for the rest of my days

When you're sad and feeling low, you're on your own with nowhere to go
Make believe that she is gone, play your guitar and write a song for her
Write down the words about how you cried when you woke up weeping
'Cos you thought that she had died, and you heard her breathing
Through your pain and you held her close and cried all over again;
Where your love is, put your heart, oh what would you do if your dreams came true?
And inside my lovely house with satin green shutters, there would be children
The most lovely children in the world...
And even when skies are grey, we would be happy, for we have love
The most lovely love in the world;
I would write it down on the wind, just for you, just for you;
And I would hold you in my arms for the rest of my days
Flying, I thought I'd never learn that flying
I thought I'd spend my whole life trying
For flying is that ancient art of keeping one foot on the ground...
Lying, I thought I'd never keep from lying
I thought I'd lose it all by sighing
For lying is that ancient art of hiding words that will never be found

Crying, I thought I'd never stop that crying
I thought I'd always dream of dying
For crying is that ancient art of weeping rivers into the ground

Oh dying, I thought I'd never see that dying
I thought I'd spend my whole life flying
For dying is that ancient art of keeping one world turning round

Sighing, I thought I'd never keep from sighing
I thought I'd always be there crying
For sighing is that ancient art of breathing sadness all around

And trying, I thought I'd spend my seasons trying
I thought I could stop myself from lying
For trying is that ancient art of proving that the world is round

Oh flying, oh oh
Lying, oh oh
Crying, oh oh
Sighing, oh oh
Trying, oh oh
And dying, oh oh
For dying is that ancient art of growing flowers in the ground
Yes it is...
Well, it's after midnight and the stars are shining bright
And a big fat moon is dancing on the sea, and I'm thinking, oh my...
And that old man in the sky he's looking me right in the eye
And he's wondering why, and he's saying "Little singer
Why aren't you sleeping, why aren't you sleeping?"
Oh, the day is hanging heavy on my eyes, I guess the time
Has come to say goodnight...

And may your dreams take you travelling all night long
With an angel by your side when the wind blows strong
Oh stay away from that city, that sad and lonely place
I will lead you to the river, here's the door
And the key is turning round
Close the shutters, do not cry, there's a new moon in the sky;
Oh hold on to your love, until your time has come to say... goodnight
[Pre-Chorus]
When you were young, and your heart was an open book
You used to say, "Live and let live"
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say, "Live and let die"
Live and let die

[Post-Chorus Solo]

[Verse]
What does it matter to ya?
When you got a job to do
You got to do it well
You got to give the other fella hell

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to say, "Live and let live"
(You know you did, you know you did, you know you did)
But if this ever-changing world in which we live in
Makes you give in and cry

[Chorus]
Say, "Live and let die"
Live and let die

[Post-Chorus Solo]
[Intro]
Rollin'
One, two, three, one, two, three
Two, three, one and

[Verse 1]
I tried so hard just to get through to you
But your head's so far from the realness of truth
Was it just a come on in the dark, was it meant to last long?
I think you've worn your welcome, honey
I'll just see you along as I sing you this song

[Bridge]
One, two, three, one

[Verse 2]
Time can pass slowly and things always change
Your days been numbered and I've read your last page
You was just a temporary lover, honey, you ain't the first
Lots of others came before you, woman
Said, but you been the worst, said, you been the worst

[Bridge]
Two, three and

[Verse 3]
So, goodbye to you, girl, so long, farewell
I can't hear you crying, your jivin's been hell
So, look for me walking down your street at night
I'll be in with another, deep down inside
Deep down inside

[Duff]:
"To the bar!"
[Slash]:
"That was a take!"
[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I can see a love restrained
But, darlin', when I hold you
Don't you know I feel the same?
Yeah...

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing lasts forever
And we both know hearts can change
And it's hard to hold a candle
In the cold November rain

[Verse 2]
We've been through this such a long, long time
Just tryna kill the pain, ooh yeah
But lovers always come and lovers always go
And no one's really sure who's lettin' go today, walkin' away
If we could take the time to lay it on the line
I could rest my head, just knowin' that you were mine, all mine

[Chorus]
So, if you want to love me
Then, darlin', don't refrain
Or I'll just end up walkin'
In the cold November rain

[Refrain]
Do you need some time on your own?
Do you need some time all alone?
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?
[Bridge]
I know it's hard to keep an open heart
When even friends seem out to harm you
But if you could heal a broken heart
Wouldn't time be out to charm you, woah-woah

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Refrain]
Sometimes, I need some time on my own
Sometimes, I need some time all alone
Ooh, everybody needs some time on their own
Ooh, don't you know you need some time all alone?
[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 3]
And when your fears subside
And shadows still remain, ooh yeah
I know that you can love me
When there's no one left to blame

[Chorus]
So, never mind the darkness
We still can find a way
'Cause nothin' lasts forever
Even cold November rain

[Guitar Solo 3]

[Outro]
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
You're not the only one, you're not the only one
Don't ya think that you need somebody?
Don't ya think that you need someone?
Everybody needs somebody
[Child's voice]
No I won't

[Verse 1: Axl Rose]
You know you're all alone, your friends, they aren't at home
Everybody's gone to the garden
As you look into the trees, you can look, but you don't see
Flowers seem to tease you at the garden
Everybody's there, but you don't seem to care
What's it with you man, and this garden?
Yeah

[Chorus: Alice Cooper]
Turned into my worst phobia
A crazy man's utopia
If you're lost, no one can show ya
But it sure was glad to know ya
Only poor boys take a chance
On the garden's song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2: Axl Rose]
You can find it all inside, no need to wrestle with your pride
No, you ain't losing your mind, you're just in the garden
They can lead you to yourself or you can throw it on the shelf
But you know you can look inside for the garden

[Chorus: Alice Cooper]
I wasn't really scared
Lost my virginity there
To a gypsy with blond hair
But now no one seems to care
Like a mouse inside a maze
Wandering 'round for daze
With a smile upon my face
I never want to leave this place
Only poor boys take a chance
On this garden song and dance
Feel her flowers, as they wrap around
But only smart boys do without
Turned into my worst phobia
It's a crazy man's utopia
If you're lost no one can show you
But it sure was glad to know you

[Outro: Alice Cooper]
Bye-bye, so long, bye-bye
It's glad to know you
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Aw, so long
[Intro]
Sick of this life, not that you'd care
I'm not the only one with whom, these feelings, I share
Nobody understands quite why we're here
We're searching for answers that never appear
Maybe if I looked real hard, I'd, I'd see you trying, too
To understand this life that we're all going through
"Then when she said she was going to, like, wreck my car
I didn't know what to do"

[Chorus]
Oh, sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
And I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
I guess some things never change
Oh, never change

[Verse]
I met an old cowboy, I saw the look in his eyes
Something tells me he's been here before 'cause experience makes you wise
I was only a small child when the thought first came to me
That I'm a son of a gun and the gun of a son that brought back the devil in me

[Chorus]
Oh, but sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
Yeah, I guess some things never change
Ooh, never change

[Bridge]
I ain't quite what you'd call an old soul
Still, wet behind the years
I've been around this track a couple of times
But now the dust is starting to clear, oh, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
I don't know why you'd be bringing me down
I'd like to think that our love's worth a tad more
It may sound funny, but you'd think, by now, I'd be smiling
Ooh, yeah, I'd be smiling
No way I'd be smiling
Ooh, smiling

[Outro]
Sick of this life, not that you'd care
I'm not the only one with whom, these feelings, I share
[Spoken Intro: Strother Martin ]
What we've got here is failure to communicate
Some men, you just can't reach
So, you get what we had here, last week
Which is the way he wants it
Well, he gets it
*Whistling*
And I don't like it any more than you men

[Intro]
Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before
Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

[Verse 1]
My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
An' the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
An' all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
An' are washed away by your genocide
An' history hides the lies of our civil wars

[Guitar Solo 1]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
D'you wear a black armband when they shot the man
Who said peace could last forever?
An' in my first memories, they shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall in D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin' for their promised land

[Chorus]
And I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Bridge]
Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
An' I don't want to hear no more

[Verse 2]
My hands are tied
For all, I've seen has changed my mind
But still, the wars go on, as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
An' all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

[Guitar Solo 2]

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We practice selective annihilation
Of mayors and government officials
For example, to create a vacuum
Then we fill that vacuum
As popular war advances
Peace is closer

[Chorus]
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich, while it buries the poor
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no no no
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry, sellin' soldiers in a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh?
I don't need your civil war
No no no no no no no no no no, no, no
I don't need one more war
Ooh, I don't need one more war
No no no, no woah, no woah

[Outro]
What's so civil 'bout war anyway?
[Verse 1: Izzy Stradlin]
I try and feel the sunshine, you bring the rain
You try and hold me down with your complaints
You cry and moan and complain, you whine an tear
Up to my neck in sorrow the touch you bring

[Pre-Chorus: Izzy Stradlin]
You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say and you know
I've been the beggar, I've played the thief
I was the dog they all tried to beat

[Chorus: Axl Rose with Izzy Stradlin]
But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

[Verse 2: Izzy Stradlin]
Your stupid girlfriends tell you, that I'm to blame
Well, they're all used up has-beens out of the game
This time I'll have the last word, you hear what I say?
I tried to see it your way, it won't work today

[Pre-Chorus: Izzy Stradlin]
You just don't step inside to, to 14 years
So hard to keep my own head, that's what I say, you know
I've been the dealer hangin' on your street
I was the dog they all tried to beat

[Chorus: Axl Rose with Izzy Stradlin]
But it's been 14 years of silence
It's been 14 years of pain
It's been 14 years that are gone forever and I'll never have again

[Verse 3: Izzy Stradlin]
Bullshit and contemplation, gossip's their trade
If they knew half the real truth, what would they say?
Well I'm past the point of concern, it's time to play
These last four years of madness sure put me straight

[Outro: Izzy Stradlin]
You don't get back 14 years in just one day
So hard to keep my own head, just go away, you know
Just like a hooker, she said, "Nothin's for free"
Oh, I tried to see it your way
I tried to see it your way
[Verse 1]
Yesterday, there was so many things I was never told
Now that I'm starting to learn, I feel I'm growing old
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Time just fades the pages in my book of memories
Prayers in my pocket, and no hand in destiny
I'll keep on movin' along with no time to plant my feet
'Cause yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
Some things could be better if we'd all just let them be

[Chorus]
Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Got nothing for me, ooh, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Yesterday, there were so many things I was never shown
Suddenly, this time I found I'm on the streets and I'm all alone
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Old pictures that I'll always see
I ain't got time to reminisce old novelties

[Chorus]
Ooh, yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday's, ooh, got nothing for me
Yesterday's got nothing for me
Yesterday

[Outro]
Yesterday
[Intro: Axl Rose]
Ooh, ooh
Hey

[Verse 1: Axl Rose]
Mama, take this badge from me
I can't use it anymore
It's gettin' dark, too dark to see
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door

[Chorus: Axl Rose]
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh-oh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ayy hey yeah
Ooh-oh yeah, oh yeah, aw

[Verse 2: Axl Rose]
Mama, put my guns in the ground (Ooh)
I can't shoot them anymore (Ooh)
That cold black cloud is comin' down (Ooh)
Feels like I'm knockin' on heaven's door (Ooh)

[Chorus: Axl Rose]
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ayy hey yeah
Ooh

[Guitar Solo]

[Spoken: Josh Richman]
You just better start sniffing your own rank subjugation, Jack
Because it's just you against your tattered libido
The bank and the mortician, forever, man
And it wouldn't be luck if you could get out of life alive

[Outro: Axl Rose, Choir & Both]
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, hey, hey, hey hey yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh, no, no, no, woah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, no, no, no, woah, no
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, woah, woah, woah, yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, ooh yeah
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door
Knock-knock-knockin' on heaven's door, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, yeah, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
When you're talkin' to yourself and nobody's home
You can fool yourself, you came in this world alone (Alone)

[Chorus]
So nobody ever told you, baby, how it was gonna be?
So what'll happen to you, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see
One, two

[Verse 1]
Old at heart, but I'm only 28
And I'm much too young to let love break my heart
Young at heart, but it's gettin' much too late
To find ourselves so far apart

[Bridge]
I don't know how you're s'posed to find me lately
An' what more could you ask from me, yay?
How could you say that I never needed you?
When you took everythin', said, you took everythin' from me
Hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
Young at heart, an' it gets so hard to wait
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart, but I mustn't hesitate
If I'm to find my own way out

[Pre-Chorus]
Still, talkin' to myself and nobody's home (Alone)

[Chorus]
So nobody ever told us, baby, how it was gonna be
So what'll happen to us, baby?
Guess we'll have to wait and see

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
When I find out all the reasons
Maybe I'll find another way, find another day
With all the changin' seasons
Of my life, maybe I'll get it right next time
An' now that you've been broken down
Got your head out of the clouds, back down on the ground
An' you don't talk so loud an' you don't walk so proud
Anymore and what for?
[Guitar Solo 1]

[Verse 4]
Well, I jumped into the river too many times to make it home
I'm out here on my own an' driftin' all alone
If it doesn't show, give it time to read between the lines
'Cause I see the storm is gettin' closer
An' the waves, they get so high
Seems everythin' we've ever known's here
Why must it drift away and die?
[Guitar Solo 2]

[Verse 5]
I'll never find anyone to replace you
Guess I'll have to make it through this time, woah, this time
Without you
I knew the storm was gettin' closer
And all my friends said I was high
But everythin' we've ever known's here
I never wanted it to die
[Verse 1]
Talk to me softly, there's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow and please don't cry
I know how you feel inside, I've, I've been there before
Something is changing inside you and don't you know?
[Chorus]
Don't you cry tonight, I still love you, baby
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

[Verse 2]
Give me a whisper and give me a sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now and please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you and the times we had, baby

[Chorus]
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry tonight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
And please remember that I never lied, oh
And please remember how I felt inside now, honey
You gotta make it your own way but you'll be alright now, sugar
You'll feel better tomorrow, come the morning light now, baby

[Chorus]
And don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight, there's a heaven above you, baby
And don't you cry
Don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight, baby, maybe someday
Don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
[Intro]
Girl, there they go again
You mean to tell me they at it again?
Child, it's the daily curse, every two weeks
Well, heh, ah

[Chorus]
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
Oh, hit the road Jack

[Verse 1]
Oh, woman, oh woman, don't treat me so mean
Meanest woman I ever seen
Guess if you say so
I said so
I'll have to pack my things and go
That's right

[Chorus]
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
Yeah, what you say?
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
Hit the road

[Verse 2]
Now baby, listen baby, don't you treat me this way
Be back on my feet one day
Don't care if you do, 'cause it's understood
You ain't got no money, you just ain't no good
I guess if you say so
I gotta pack my bags and go, hey

[Chorus]
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
One more time
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
(Don't you come back no more)

[Bridge]
You don't mean no good
You don't clean house
You don't cook
Hit the road
You might as well get up and pack
Go and hit the road Jack
Hit that road now Jack
Hit that road now Jack
Hit that road now
Get the hell out

[Chorus]
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
What you say?
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
(Don't you come back no more)
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
(No more)
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back
No more, no more, no more, no more
Hit the road Jack, don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Don't you come back no more
Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again

Well, I'm an old man now and I'm born to win the race
People won't believe me but there's truth in what I say
Many hearts were broken and a lot of tears were shed
The sky was black and the battlefield was red

Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again 

Now, Stonewall Jackson stepped right up and then he said to me
He said: The battle is getting rough, son, guess we better flee
There's grapeshot all around us and the field is black with lead
You better start running boy before you lose your head

Now it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again

Well, the cannons roared around us and the field was black with lead
I picked a soldier dressed in blue and filled him full of lead
I picked out six more soldiers there sitting on a mound
I fixed my bayonet to my gun and really mowed them down

Now, it's gone, gone, gone, those years have passed away
It's gone, gone, gone, there's truth in what I say
It's gone, gone, gone, there's nothing more to say
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again
But I'd do anything if I could do it all again
Kiss me once, oh yeah, baby
Kiss me twice, oh yeah, crazy
Kiss me three times
The three kisses of love, oh yeah

Morning, noon, and at night

Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Whoa, whoa, whoa

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Timber baby cause I'm a-fallin' for you
Take hold of that star I give to you
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you

I'd give you the moon or the sun
Or the starlights with a love so true
And if it rains, I'll give you a rainbow too

Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you

I'd give you the moon or the sun
Or the starlights with a love so true
And if it rains, I'll give you a rainbow too

Take hold of that star and put it in your locket
And tell me that you love me
Just as I love you
La la la... as I love you
Ah...
Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue
Some may say you don't play, you have a heart that's true
But how can they believe what you say, you only make me blue

You hurt me and you fool around
You don't even give me a chance
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance

Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue
Ah...

You hurt me and you fool around
You don't even give me a chance
Well it's over and I'm telling you
It's the end of our romance

Some may find peace of mind loving a girl like you
But I can say, in your way, you only make me blue
Ah...
Please believe me, I will never be untrue
And don't believe the jealous lies they told to you
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye

Now don't you know I love you more than I can say
And it would mean my life if you should run away
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye

You just won't listen to my pleas
You want me beggin' on my knees

So sit right down and listen while I beg, you see
I'll never be untrue, so please believe in me
Oh no, don't go, don't make this poor boy cry
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye
I'll be true, I beg of you, don't say goodbye
I'd like to be the one to see your loving mind at the start
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys in your heart
I'd like to know how far you'd go to use those lips of wine
But I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind

Oh, one, two, three and now there's me
You practice to deceive
You lead me on , another one
I've got no room to breathe

So byebye you who can't be true, I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind

I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind

Oh, one, two, three and now there's me
You practice to deceive
You lead me on, another one
I've got no room to breathe

So byebye you who can't be true, I'm leaving you behind
'Cause I get claustrophobia 'cause there's too many boys on your mind
Too many boys on your mind
Too many boys on your mind
Look at me
I don't know what I'm doing
Ever since I looked at you
How did I get this crazy feeling?
Could it be I'm in love with you?
Ever since I saw you in the moonlight
I've had this feeling through and through
Since that time, I haven't done a thing right
Could it be I'm in love with you?
Oh golly gee
I don't know where I'm going
I'm trying to make you see
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me

Oh, night after night, I'm always dreaming
Why don't you make those dreams come true?
Can't you see how much I really love you?
Why don't you learn to love me too?
Oh golly gee
I don't know where I'm going
I'm trying to make you see
Oh boy, I got to make her fall in love with me

Oh, night after night, I'm always dreaming
Why don't you make those dreams come true?
Can't you see how much I really love you?
Why don't you learn to love me too?
Love me too
Love me too
There is someone walking behind you
Turn around, look at me
There is someone watching your footsteps
Turn around, look at me

There is someone tells you love you
It's my heart, it's my heart
Turn around, look at me, at the start

There is someone standing beside you
Turn around (turn around), look at me (look at me)
There is someone to love and guide you
Turn around (turn around), look at me (look at me)

I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me
Turn around, look at me
Turn around, look at me

I'll be waiting for now and forever
For you to come to me
Turn around, look at me
Turn around (turn around), look at me
From mountains high to valleys low, they speak the name of Jaimie-O
Who with his pa, went searching for that gold in old California
By riverboat and wagon train, old Doc McPheeters crossed the plains
And told his son, keep moving on there's gold in old California
Go westward ho, young Jaimie-O and you'll find fortune and fame

And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
McPheeters' name still shines like gold from Maine to old California
Go westward ho, young Jaimie-O, and you'll find fortune and fame
And to this day when tales are told of pioneers a thousand fold
McPheeters' name still shines like gold from Maine to old California
From Maine to old California
There was a little girl I planned to marry
If this was my love I didn't want to share
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny
But she said she could not love me 'cause I didn't have no money

Every day I have to cry so
Drying the water from my eyes so
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry

I got me a girl
I guess I really love her
'cause every night I've been thinking over
But you can't live all your love this morning
But if you do it's gonna hurt somebody
Every day I have to cry so
Drying the water from my eyes so
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry

I thought I know she's just a woggle (?)
If she found a love because she's not a rich girl (?)
But every time you reach love this morning (?)
Every time it's gonna hurt somebody

Every day I have to cry so
Drying the water from my eyes so
Till the clouds slowly pass by (?)
Every day I have to cry
Come a bit close to me, let me be kissed
Come on and give to me what I have missed
I love you woman, I know that I'll get you somehow
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well, I'm telling you now

Morning and nighttime too, I'm so alone
Your love and my love, girl, we shall be one
I'm gonna get you or else there will be a big row
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well, I'm telling you now

I go to sleep at night, I'm telling you now
My heart is asking me why, I'm telling you now
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well, I'm telling you now

Come a bit close to me, let me be kissed
Come on and show to me what I have missed
I love you woman, I know that I'll get you somehow
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so
You wouldn't know if I hadn't told you so, oh
Well I'm telling you now

I'm telling you now...
Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs, the things I never had
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
What shall I do (what shall I do)
What shall I do (what shall I do)

Cars and buses and trams make a lot of noise
All my women have gone out with other boys
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
I won't complain (I won't complain)
I feel no pain (I feel no pain)

Ooh..
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
I won't complain (I won't complain)
I feel no pain (I feel no pain)

Wine and women and song will only make me sad
Love and kisses and hugs, the thing I never had
If this should end, I don't mind
If this should end, I will find
I won't complain (I won't complain)
I feel no pain (I feel no pain)
I won't complain, cry
I'm so weary from holding this load
But it's only, love for you, that I walk this lonely road
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
And the wind will take me hold before the cold

Ev'ry stay I have counted
Each flower I have seen
But the place I am going, there's no grass as green
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
And the wind will take me home where I can dream

In the hour I am lonely, your love will be mine
I will stay in your arms dear, until comes the time
I must be on my way for my home is anywhere
I have no time to stay, I have no time to care
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair

I must follow the wind, follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair
I must follow the wind, follow the wind
As the wind gently blows in my hair
Ah, ah, ah, ah..
I was a lover, a leader of men
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground
I didn't know I was on the way down
Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

Ah, ah, ah, ah..
I had a billion or two in the bank
I gave to charity, ain't got no thanks
You gave me all that a woman could give
Less your affection, I don't want to live
Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

Cause you don't feel the same

I was a lover, a leader of men
All of the women I knew were my friends
I was so happy, my feet on the ground
I didn't know, I was on the way down
Cause you don't feel the same
It's only a game, it's only a game, it's only a game

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...
Ah...
Well, I been working up a fever trying to
Straighten up the mess in my mind about this place
I can't contain myself anymore
Can't you see it's written all over my face
Why don't you get on your feet
It's about time you got to think
What ever happened to peace
Well open your eyes and you'll see children laughing
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' ah...

You're always talkin' right and talkin about
The world and its corruption and moral decay
But what you gonna do about it, nothing
'cause you're more like children than children while they play
Why, you're so clean through and through you won't shake hands
With a negro who's maybe cleaner then you
Well listen around and you'll hear children laughin'
Voices singin', hearts a-beatin' like they always do
So what's wrong with you, ah...

You're so blown up with anger about the world
You write the songs about
Yet you don't even know your neighbors name
Now you want to go the the moon and live there
When you know it'll only end up the same
How can he give you any gratitude
With your endless sickenin' attitude
You strive to get ahead
But you leave each other dead
Can't you see, children laughin'
Voices singin', hearts beatin' like they always do
So what's wrong with you, ah...

Children laughin', voices singin' hearts beatin'
Children laughin', voices singin
You get your pleasures out of hurting me, honey
You get your kicks out of watching me cry
You play around an awful lot to hurt me, honey
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes

I don't think it's funny, honey
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine

If I was yours and you were mine, my little honey
We could be happy till the very day I die
But all you ever want to do is hurt me, honey
Why do you laugh when there are tears in my eyes

I don't think it's funny, honey
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine

I don't think it's funny, honey
My skies are not so sunny
Why don't you make up your mind
Let me put my arms around you
Make rainbows all around you
But I don't know if you are mine

But I don't know if you are mine
But I don't know if you are mine
Ooh, love was true yesterday
I love you ev'ry way
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
And then I knew, I had to have you

You could be mine if you tried
All that you do is tell me lies
You think that love's a game
But I don't feel the same
I should have known that I'll get the pain

Ooh, love was true yesterday
I love you ev'ry way
I saw you standing there
You gave me cause to stare
And then knew I had to have you
You build me up, you let me down
How can I love, you give me no ground
To be or not to be, to be or not to be
Am I gonna have you for me?
One little light I saw before
The light in your eyes, I don't see no more
To be or not to be, to be or not to be
Am I gonna have you for me, well?
Give me a chance, make up your mind
Give me romance, tell me you're mine
To be or not to be, well, to be or not to be
Am I gonna have you for me, well?
Well, to be or not to be
Well, to be or not to be
To be or not to be
Am gonna have you for me?
Well, to be or not to be
Well, to be or not to be
To be or not to be
Am gonna have you for me?
Well, to be or not to be
Well, to be or not to be
To be or not to be
Am gonna have you for me?
Where are you
Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb
Sweeter still when we're alone
Cherry red, my cherry red

Turquoise green , greener than the deeper sea
Greener still when she's with me
Cherry red , my cherry red

I wonder why (wonder why)
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
I wonder why (wonder why)
She's true to me the way that she will always be

Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb
Sweeter still when we're alone
Cherry red , my cherry red

I wonder why (wonder why)
The stars that night shine big and bright for me
I wonder why (wonder why)
She's true to me the way that she will always be

Cherry red , sweeter than the honeycomb
Sweeter still when we're alone
Cherry red, my cherry red

At the end of a rainbow
You'll find a pot of gold
At the end of a story
You'll find it's all been told
But our love has a treasure our hearts always spend
And it has a story without any end

At the end of a river
The water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time

At the end of a river, the water stops its flow
At the end of a highway, there's no place you can go
But just tell me you love and you are only mine
And our love will go on till the end of time
Till the end of time
Let me tell 'bout a gal I know
She's my baby and she lives next door
Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She brings my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I got no friend
I know she'll go with me down to the end
Everybody asks me how do I know
I smile a damn and say she told me so
That why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
Tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
When there ain't nobody hanging 'round
She just kisses me, and then holds me tight
And tells me, baby, everything's gonna be alright
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just, I love her so
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so
I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you
No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you
There's a place for us
Somewhere a place for us
Peace and quiet and open air
Wait for us
Somewhere
There's a time for us
Some day a time for us
Time together with time spare
Time to look, time to care
Some day!
Somewhere
We'll find a new way of living
We'll find a way of forgiving
Somewhere
There's a place for us
A time and place for us
Hold my hand and we're half way there
Hold my hand and I'll take you there
Somehow
Some day
Somewhere
You ask how much I need you
Must I explain
I need you oh my darling
Like roses need rain
You ask how long I'll love you
I'll tell you true
Until the twelfth of never I'll still be loving you
Hold me close
Never let me go
Hold me close
Melt my heart like April snow
I'll love you 'till the blue bells forget to bloom
I'll love you 'till the clover has lost its perfume
I'll love you 'till the poets run out of rhyme
Oh, until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
Until the twelfth of never
And that's a long long time
You're the reason I'm living
You're the breath that I take
You're the stars in my heaven
You're the sun when I wake
You're the reason I'm living
Oh you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you

A long long time ago
When I was down
Wo-o-o you picked me up
And showed me true love
Still could be found

You're the reason I do things
You're the things that I do
You're the reason I'm livin
I'd be lost without you

Come and tell me again
You're the reason I'm living
Oh you carry me through
All of life's little burdens
I'd be lost without you
You're nobody till somebody loves you
You're nobody till somebody cares
You might be king, you might possess, the world and its gold
But gold won't bring you happiness, when you're growing old
The world still is the same
You'll never change it
As sure as the stars shine above
You're nobody till somebody loves you
So find yourself somebody to love
I know my street, that's where I live
I never take, I always give
They always leave me on the shelf
I live my life all by myself

My car ain't big, I can't go fast
And ev'ry drink I take's the last
I'm always tryin' to save my health
I live my life all by myself

Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me
I'm a man who stands alone
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be

So take your hand down off my chair
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there
And I ain't neve seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself

My car ain't big, I can't go fast
And ev'ry drink I take's the last
I'm always tryin' to save my health
I live my life all by myself

Ev'rything I have I own and no one lives on me
I'm a man who stands alone
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be
That's where I'll be

So take your hand down off my chair
'cause I'm the one who's sitting there
And I ain't never seen no wealth
I live my live all by myself

I live my life all by myself
Green fields where we used to wander
Purple valleys, near my home
We would play there, beneath the sky
And then I kissed you, butterfly

Young girl, you came restless
And you left me here to cry
My big teardrops, in red pastures
For I loved you, butterfly

Butterfly, yeah
I dream about you, lonely without you, butterfly
Butterfly, yeah
Each night I'm sleeping, your face goes creeping, butterfly

Green fields where we used to wander
Purple valleys, near my home
We would play there beneath the sky
And I kissed you, butterfly

Butterfly, yeah
I dream bout you, lonely without you, butterfly
Butterfly, yeah
Each night I'm sleeping, your face goes creeping, butterfly
Oh, can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
'Cause if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart

And don't you know I love her so
And I'll never, never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too

People talk and try to break us up
When they know they don't understand
But I don't care what the people may say
I'm gonna keep on holdin' her hand

Can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And yet they try so very hard to pull us apart
But we don't care what they say
We're gonna keep on lovin' this way
'Cause if they break us up
You know it'll only break my heart

Don't you know I love her so
And I'll never, never, never let her go
No matter what the people may say or try to do
'Cause can't you see that she's mine
We've been together for a long long time
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she loves me too
And it'll stay that way
Because I know she'll love me too

To Monday's rain (Monday's rain)

In this my life, I walk in light
You are my love so baby I'm all right
Don't let me down, baby

Don't walk on me
My Sunday sunshine
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
Hide Monday's rain (Monday's rain)
Monday's rain (Monday's rain) Ah...
There are times that I should go away
To think of you and I
For it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life

In the night time when I lie awake
And think of you in my heart
For it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life

Oh wouldn't you believe me if I told you
That I love you, and I do
Ev'ryone believes me when I tell them
Why don't you, why don't you

When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life

La...
All of my life, all of my life

Oh wouldn't you believe if I told you
That I love you, and I do
Ev'ryone believes me when I tell them
Why don't you, why don't you

When I think of things that ought to be
And I feel your hand in mine
Yes it isn't only now, I need your love
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life
All of my life
All of my life
Where are you (where are you)
Night is day and day is night
Where are you (where are you)
Need you girl you re not in sight
Our love would grow, but you leave and I know
That you don't love me (where are you)
I need you girl, you're not in sight
I told you (I told you)
I was never coming back -ah
You told me (You told me)
You would give my love the sack-ah
Now as I fly, you won't tell me goodbye
Cause you don't love me (where are you)

Now you give my love the sack-ah
Now as my heart lies in pieces of eight
You were a part of my love but too late
I love you (I love you)
This I think that you should know
I' ll be blue (I'll be blue)
You are still cause I must
I'd like to stay but I know you won't play
And see things my way (where are you)
You are still cause I must go
You are still cause I must
I must go (where are you)
I'm not a ghost, I am a man
I only do the best I can
Believing I will find a way
It's just a price that you must pay

All my friends, they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play

I play the game, I see the light
I walk in day, you walk in night
Believe me boy, it ain't no good
In doin' what you never should

All my friends, they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play

All my friends, they put me down
So I go from town to town
They all say that I'm a clown
They play high and I play down
They play high and I play
People in their pride believe it's easier for them to leave
Their problems in the arms of others , running to their mothers
Lasting love is such a funny thing
When you're in love you're on the wings
You're not in love, it's good for you
'cause you can do the things you want to do

It's you big chance , to take it baby
It's you big chance , you'll make it baby

When you're high and mighty you'll remember how I loved you
You'll be thinkin' how you hurt me when I needed you beside me
In the night is such a lonely time
I dream of you and that's a sign
It means that I am still a fool
And I am still so much in love with you

It's your big chance, so take it baby
It's your big chance, don't fake it baby

Big chance
Hot chance
Glass house, that once was mine, the sun will shine in on me
You, change your mind, you weren't the kind to live on me
I remember yesterday, turn my tears to laugher
Then you left and like a stray, I came running after

I remember you at night, palm trees softly swaying
I remember all the words you were softly saying

Glass house upon the hill so big and still, the shady lane
It's ours, my love, until the day we say auf wiedersehen
I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm goin' crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
How many times must I tell you I love
Tell you I love you times before
Don't believe that I'm worth all your kisses
I'm worth more then this , but you ignore

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
I will be crying, yeah

Maybe tomorrow you'll come walkin' my way
Come talkin' my way , you'll find out
My love for you will be stronger then truer
I'll look at you and there's no doubt

How many birds will I see high and flying
How many birds will it take till I get you
I will be crying, yeah

I was so lonely without you baby, don't know what I'm gonna do
I'm going crazy without you baby, look at what I'm goin' through
Baby, baby, baby
See the cracks upon the wall
We do not know the meaning of it all
Ain't no fire to warm my feet
Ain't got a nickel for a bit to ear
We're not workin', we're not slavin'
Ain't worth a brain, 'cause we're not worth savin'
Second hand people, tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle, in a pond are we
Second hand people

Ain't no mirror to comb my face
Just keep on going from place to place
Ain't got no lights above my head
Don't even bother to leave my bed
We're not livin' ,we're existin'
We're not movin' ,just resistin'
Second hand people, tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle , in a pond are we
Second hand people , tall as a steeple
Softer than treacle ....
I'm a fool, I've taken no advice
And I'm so cruel, I'm talkin' to you nice
But then again you may not take me back
Oh just to put my hat back on your rack
Guess I don't know why I bother with myself
You will find a part of me in someone else
I never argued with the fact that she is mine
I only hurt her and kissed her three times out of nine
You have the edge to talk to men and make them feel at home
You spent that every lasting cent on someone that's not your own
Bear with me there's bound to be a chance
To heal the wound and start back our romance
I gained a heart and part of it is yours
Oh just to see my love walk through these doors
Oh and my life's bound out ahead, I can not look
And if you read me, then I am just a book
You don't care if rain falls in my room
You won't be there if trouble fills my spoon
I'm just a clown that plays around with misery in my way
Forgetting all the rules of love ...
Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She likes to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

We used to cry on each others shoulder
Now that I'm older, she wanders ahead
Now that she's found love, I still hear the sound of
Silvery bangles, remain in my head

Jingle jangle, my love wears silvery bangles
She used to wander and that's why I'm under
The spell of her jingle jangle

Mmm...
A tint of blue , deep down inside my heart, each time I see you
It would take a lot to ease my pain from all these chains

A tint of red , each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover , jealous I
I get so angry I could cry

A tint of blue , why do you make me feel so sad
Why do you leave me feeling bad they way I do
A tint of blue

A tint of red , each time I see you with another
Just because I was your lover, jealous I
I get so angry I could cry
When I was just a little boy, when I didn't know
My daddy put me on his knee and showed me the way to go
He said "a woman will do her best to make a fool out of you
So be a man and stand the test and see what you can do"

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

If you got what it takes my boy
You can always choose
Work it out before it's too late my boy
Make sure you never lose

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man...

Ev'ry woman wants her man to live and learn on her land
Where I go, baby you go
Arrangement, man and wife

I'm glad I am born a man
I'm glad I am born a man

Born a man...
[Verse 1]
Where is the sun
That shone
On my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

[Verse 2]
Where is the light
That would play
In my streets
And where are the friends
I could meet
I could meet

[Hook]
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

[Verse 1]
Where is the sun
That shone
On my head
The sun in my life
It is dead
It is dead

[Hook]
Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where are the girls
I left far behind
The spicks and the specks
Of the girls on my mind

Where is the girl
Now, you know, there's so many thing you could do on this stage
That's not one of them
Hahaha
Oh, no, right - yeah, ok
I get you

[Solo - Barry Gibb]
Where is the girl
I loved all along
The girl that I loved
She's gone
She's gone

[Chorus - Var.
1]
All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away

All of my life
I call yesterday
The spicks and the specks
Of my life've gone away

[Outro]
Everybody
Spicks and specks
Spicks and specks, yeah
Ahh, spicks and specks
I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain
I'm the kind of man you can't explain

True love is one thing I've been dreaming of
I give my love to you.
And when I do
You are to me, the very deepest part of me

I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be

When you hurt me, then I become the night time
The shadows in my eyes don't make it good for
Me to see the way I should

I am the world
I am the sky
I am the sea
I'm anything that you want me to be

I'm the sun, I'm the falling rain
I'm the kind of man that you can't explain

I am the world
I am the world
What a day for a daydream
What a day for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy

And even if time ain't really on my side
It's one of those days for takin' a walk outside
I'm blowing the day to take a walk in the sun
And fall on my face on somebody's new mowed lawn

I've been having a sweet dream
Been dreaming since I woke up today
It's starring me and my sweet dream
'Cause she's the one makes me feel this way

And even if time is passing me by a lot
I couldn't care less about these blues you say I've got
Tomorrow I'll pay the dues for dropping so low
A pie in the face for being a sleepy beau deau

And you can be sure that if you're feeling right
A daydream'll last along into the night
Tomorrow at breakfast you may perk up your ears
Or you may be daydreaming for a thousand years
What a day for a daydream
Custom made for a daydreaming boy
And now I'm lost in a daydream
Dreaming 'bout my bundle of joy
Hush my darling , sleep my lover
There'll be rain till we run for cover
Lost in love in a world of strangers
Something only the Lord arranges

Oh my darling , now I found you
Want to live all my life around you
You're my light in a world of sorrow
Scared of losing this dream tomorrow

I just want to hold you forever , forever
Loving one another that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

Oh my darling , if you leave me
I lose the love that has always freed me
Not knowing angel , what's coming after
Never hearing you're golden laughter

Oh my baby , hearts like thunder
Can't escape from the spell I'm under
I surrender to all your treasure
Endless nights of pain and pleasure

I just want to hold you , forever , forever
Loving one another , that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me

I just want to hold you , forever , forever
Loving one another , that's how it should be
Needing you beside me , together , no never
Try to rediscover no other but me
I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I've been waiting for the coalman
He's a whole man and he treats me nice
Ev'rybody needs a coalman
When you're low man , you can get advice
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody, when she's not there

I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He makes a man feel good when he's down
Head is touching the ground
He's going to help you if he can
He's a coalman

I need her loving so much the feeling is too much to bear
You've got to have somebody when she's not there

I tell my troubles to the coalman
He's a coalman but he understands
He's not such a very very old man
He's a soul man and he takes my hand
He's gonna help you when he's down
When your head is touching the ground
And he'll help you if he can
He's a coalman
Coalman, coalman , coalman
Baby, I've got a one-way ticket to nowhere
Ain't got hundreds, so I count money in this chair
Exit, stage right.
Baby, I get stage fright
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share

Sold my car and I got no transport in this town
One night, baby, you'll look for me.
I won't be around
Exit, stage right.
Baby, I get stage fright
And my baby runs this show and she's got a big share

I.......
If I fall in love , it's only with you
And if I call for love, it's got to be true
But if you fail .
to keep it a tie
Then I'll know, it's only a lie
And I'll know what to do
Oh, I'll know what to do

If you wear my ring , you wear it for me
You've got to wear that thing indefinitely
And if you're bad , even just for a while
I'll be sad , then I'll push you behind
'cause I know what to do
Oh I know what to do

I.......
I am a man of words, the few words I say
If you play my game , you play it my way
If you don't , one look in your eye
And I'll know, you're telling me lies
And I'll know what to do
I know what to do

I.....
Oh I'll know what to do
Oh I'll know what to do
In the morning, when the moon is at its rest
You will see me at the time I love the best
Watching rainbows play on sunlight
Pools of water iced from cold nights
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life

In the daytime I will meet you as before
You will find me waiting by the ocean floor
Building castles in the shifting sands
In a world that no one understands
In the morning
'Tis the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life

In the morning of my life
The minutes take so long to drift away
Please be patient with your life
It's only morning and you're still to live your day

In the evening I will fly you to the moon
To the top right hand corner of
The ceiling in my room
Where we'll stay until the sun shines
Another day to swing on clothes lines
May I be yawning
'Tis the morning of my life
'Tis the morning of my life

In the morning

In the morning
Ev'rything I want I got , and I got you girl
You really fool me , baby, to my little world
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else
I love you like nobody else

Put yourself in my place
Do you love me too
Take a look at my face
The world I say is you
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else
I love you and nobody else

Play you no games girl (play you no games girl)

Oh take my loving hands girl (take my hands girl)

Now the summer's gone
And the winter's coming on
And I wait for you
But I know that you have gone away from me
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter

Just to walk alone
And leave all the love we've known
Autumn leaves will fall
Wish winter would only call you back to me
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter

It, I know, could be a very long time
I can't make your love mine
Mine and mine alone
But I know that I can't make you love me
I can't make you want me
Till the winter's gone

Leaves begin to fall
And the trees begin to bare
Then I wait for you
But I know that you're not here
You've gone away
And I know, yes I know
It's gonna be a lonely winter
I been the mayor in this old town
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
I am a woman's man , females all around
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
I'm respected , I am detested , lo
What they really don't know is
I shot a man in ellenburg, long long time ago
(lum-de lum-de-loo

Well, I'll be a lawman's piece of cake
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
But before they get me , my life I'll take
(lum-de lum-de-loo)
I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
'cause I love a woman in this town
I'm marrying her today

I'll be the biggest thing that's happened here
And that's the way it's gonna stay
'cause I love a woman in this town
Marrying her today ..
Can you hear me
Are you near me
Can you see me
See me at all
Do you know me
Can you show me
If you hear me
Don't let me fall
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I maybe dying I will bide my love
I'll be waiting , I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting , in the storm

You were my girl in the springtime
With the sunshine in my day
Your sweet lips, your fingertips
And you touch me but you won't stay
Is it raining in the sunshine
And the wind blows in my eyes
Lying face down to the hard ground
I can face the cloudy skies
And although I may be dying I will bide my love
I'll be waiting , I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting , in the storm
Can you hear me
Are you near me
In the storm
I know that she loves you now
But your heart doesn't keep any vows
And that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way to hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world

Her heart isn't for a game
So tell her , you don't feel the same
For that's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way , you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way you treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world

Oh, so sad ,leaving her behind
And if you give me the chance to take her hand
And try to change her mind
For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world

For it's a terrible way to treat your baby
A terrible way you hurt that girl
It's a terrible way to treat your baby
When you know that I love her
More than anything in this world
I loved you all the summer through
I thought I'd found my dream in you
For me you were the one
But that was yesterday and yesterday's gone

We walked together hand in hand
'cross miles and miles of golden sand
But now it's over and done
'cause that was yesterday and yesterday's gone

We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait 'til summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when

Our love had just begun
I loved you yesterday and yesterday's gone

We had such happiness together
I can't believe it's gone forever
Wait 'til summer comes again
I hope that you'll remember when

Our love had just begun
I loved you yesterday and yesterday's gone

Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
Yesterday's gone
When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lost my mind
If you won't see me
You won't see me

I don't know why
You should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't gave much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
You won't see me
Life is just a bore
It's a drag to leave my door
Guess I'll have to say
I just cry my life away
I'll buy a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings

Put it on my head and each time I head to bed
Put it in a box near my dirty shoes an socks

I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings

I like that top hat
Do you?
Yes
Would you like to buy that?
Of course.
how much is that ?
3 pound 6 then please sir 
Thank you

I'll but a top hat to brighten up my lonely life
And they can see that I've got the money for the things money brings
And until she comes and she brings me happiness
This is what I want , nothing more, nothing less
Just one look and I felt so wild
Felt so wild in love with you
I found out how good it feels
Just how good to have your love

Say you will, you will be mine
You'll be mine forever and always
Just one look and I knew
That you were my only one

I thought I was dreaming
But I was so wrong
But I'm gonna keep on scheming
Till I can make you all of my own

So you see I really care
Without you I'm nothing
Just one look and I know
I'll get you someday
Just one look
That's all it took
I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today, yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me
Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

I think I'm gonna be sad
I think it's today yeah
The girl that's driving me mad
Is going away, yeah
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride

But she don't care

I don't know why she's ridin' so high
She ought to think twice

Before she gets to saying goodbye
She ought to think twice
She ought to do right by me

She said that living with me
Is bringing her down, yeah
For she would never be free
When I was around
Ah, she's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
She's got a ticket to ride
But she don't care

My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
My baby don't care, my baby don't care
Well, I travel at a speed
Of a reborn man
I got a lot of love to give
From the mirrors of my hand
I said a message of love
Don't you run away
Look at your heart
Come along with me today

Well I am what I am thank you
Some people just don't understand
Find yourself first
And then your tool
Find yourself first
Don't you be no fool

Here comes a woman
Wrapped up in chains
Messin' with that fool babe
Your life is pain
If you want to be free
Come along with me
Don't mess with the man
He'll never understand
I said find yourself first
And then your talent
Work hard in your mind
So if you come alive
You better prove to the man
You're as strong as him
'Cause in the eyes of god
You're both children to him

Everybody come alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody love alive
Everybody hear my message

I'm looking out the window pane
And I hear the sound of pouring rain
But you're not here
Where did you go
I wanna know what made you go away
What went wrong?
I'm looking out my window pane
And I hear the sound of pouring rain
There's no-one here to laugh with me
To make the dark clouds disappear
My love, what went wrong?
Where did you go - there is no answer
I need you now much more than ever
Where did you go - why can't you be with me
Where did you go - we were so tender
Where did you go - why not surrender
Only you can set me free

I'm looking out my window pane (Oh yes)
And I hear the sound of pouring rain
I think of you, of someone who can
Always count on love so true
And I'm here - where are you?
Tell me...
I think of you, of someone who can
Always count on love so true
And I'm here - where are you?
Where did you go - there is no answer
I need you now much more than ever
Where did you go - why can't you be with me
Where did you go - we were so tender
Where did you go - why not surrender
Only you can set me free

Where did you go - there is no answer
I need you now much more than ever
Where did you go - why can't you be with me
Where did you go - we were so tender
Where did you go - why not surrender
Only you can set me free
10.000 Lightyears somewhere out in space
They practice love and they know what it takes
No competition and no jealousy
Living in freedom and humanity

10.000 Lightyears away, lightyears away far from pain
Came to a place full of grace and of peace
10.000 Lightyears away from our fear

Suddenly it's ringing in my ears
Why is it now I don't wanna be here
I feel like flow in that clock at the wall
God, how I wish that this dream would go on

10.000 Lightyears away, lightyears away far from pain
Came to a place full of grace and of peace
10.000 Lightyears away from our fear

10.000 Lightyears somewhere out in space (10.000 Lightyears)
10.000 Lightyears somewhere out in space (10.000 Lightyears)
10.000 Lightyears somewhere out in space (10.000 Lightyears)
10.000 Lightyears somewhere out in space (10.000 Lightyears)

3rd verse - on Promo-LP 206 318-000 only!!!
Reality comes knocking at my door
I face the same obligations once more
Dreams took me 10.000 lightyears away
I'd give all I got if that's where I could stay
What a beautiful morning
Just to wake up beside you
Is something I've missed for so long
I'm so glad that you came back home

Baby let me tell you
How my days slipped away
And how I was afraid of the night
But now I'm alright

I feel good
Feeling like a lover should
What else can I say
Won't forget the day
You came back to stay
I feel so good (I feel good, I feel good, I feel good)
Finally we understood
You and me were meant
True lovers from the start
We can never part

Our love is grown stronger
More than any temptation
In this world could possibly be
There's no doubt 'cause it's plain to see

I feel good
Feeling like a lover should
What else can I say
Won't forget the day
You came back to stay
I feel so good (I feel good, I feel good, I feel good)
Finally we understood
You and me were meant
True lovers from the start
We can never part

I feel good
Feeling like a lover should
What else can I say
Won't forget the day
You came back to stay
I feel so good (I feel good, I feel good, I feel good)
Finally we understood
You and me...
Time, changer of seasons, time will see another flower growing
Climb over the mountains, there you'll find warm winds blowing

Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world

I cannot believe it, everywhere I see lonely faces
Why have we no answers, just some more empty places?
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world

Time, changer of seasons, time will see another flower growing
Climb over the mountains, there you'll find warm winds blowing

Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world

Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find
He's a Casanova (Yeah yeah what'd I say?)
He's a busy lover (Yeah yeah what'd I say?)
Everybody's trying to tell me
That I'm wasting time away
Too cool for one woman (Yeah yeah what'd I say?)
My Bel Ami - I'm born to be with you
My Bel Ami - I don't care what you do
My Bel Ami - Whenever you're with me
My Bel Ami - I'm happy (What'd I say)

My Bel Ami
My Bel Ami

It won't last forever (Yeah yeah what'd I say?)
He's just like the weather (Yeah yeah what'd I say?)
Life with him is so exciting
Heights to the lows from day to day
Something's always happening (Yeah yeah what'd I say?)
My Bel Ami - I'm born to be with you
My Bel Ami - I don't care what you do
My Bel Ami - Whenever you're with me
My Bel Ami - I'm happy (What'd I say)

My Bel Ami

My Bel Ami

3rd verse, unreleased:
He can't deny some offers ... yeah yeah what I say
He's got more than the others ... yeah yeah what I say
Why should I be mad about it
That's the price I have to pay
In a world of competition ... yeah yeah what I say
They got the luxury money can buy
They're living like kings and queens
The whole world's crying whenever they cry
They smile when they smile at scenes
What's left of all that glamour and glory
You find behind the doors in Hollywood

Living like a moviestar
Tell me how they really are
Prisoners of roles
Until their final curtains fall
Living like a moviestar
I don't think I go too far
If I say they're lonely after all

Too much of everything
Too much to choose
They finally lose control
Crime and insanity, scandals and booze
They're dying 'fore getting old
What's left of all that glamour and glory
You find behind the doors in Hollywood

Living like a moviestar
Tell me how they really are
Prisoners of roles
Until their final curtains fall
Living like a moviestar
I don't think I go too far
If I say they're lonely after all

Living like a moviestar
Tell me how they really are
Prisoners of roles
Until their final curtains fall...

First time that I saw you girl
I knew that I just had to make you mine
But it's so hard to talk to you

All the time
I want you so much behind
But you keep playing hard to get
I'm going round in circles all the time

Dizzy, I'm so dizzy
My head is spinning

Making it spin
You're making me dizzy

Proud in the morning sun
Day has just begun
She's a queen riding on the waves
So many miles away
Sailing many a day
Brave in dark storms and hurricanes

Bringing something for everyone
From far-off lands underneath the sun

Here comes the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea
Here comes the Alibama, sailing homewards to you and to me

The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea

Here comes the Alibama-ma
Here comes the Alibama-ma
Here comes the Alibama-ma
Here comes the Alibama-ma

Sailing the seven seas
Like a bird on the breeze
Oh how she travelled far and wide
Now she is nearly at home
Not much longer alone
Coming back on the morning tide

Unreleased:
Bring us home, wind up high in the mast
Keep us safe, hold her steady and fast

(Unreleased verse:) And the people at home
Have been waiting so long
Through the tears and the pain
'Cause they're sailing home again

Bringing something for everyone
From far-off lands underneath the sun

Here comes the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea
Here comes the Alibama, sailing homewards to you and to me

The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea
The Alibama, the Alibama...

Say goodbye, my own true lover
As we sing a lover's song
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival is gone
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival is gone

Say goodbye, my own true lover
As we sing a lover's song
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival is gone

High above, the dawn is waking
And my tears are falling rain
For the carnival is over;
We may never meet again
For the carnival is over;
We may never meet again

Like a drum my heart was beating
And your kiss was sweet as wine
But the joys of love are fleeting
For Pierrot and Columbine

Now the harbour light is calling;
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you 'til I die

Say goodbye, my own true lover
As we sing a lover's song
How it breaks my heart to leave you
Now the carnival is gone

Say goodbye, my own true lover
This will be our last goodbye
Though the carnival is over
I will love you 'til I die

Though the carnival is over
I will love you 'til I die

Though the carnival is over
I will love you 'til I die

I phoned the agency, a man replied to me
Hey I'm sorry, I have no vacancy
I'm really gettin' mad
I know there's gotta be a wind up
Baby keep cool or we will never find a

We work so hard all day (yo yo)
My head is blowing round
I need some time to play
Go out and boogie down

Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter

There's someone at the door
The one we're waiting for
But there is no one and now our wish is gone
I even pay the rates or even double the money
Go out and you will see, but you'll agree with me

We gotta find a
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter

Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo
Babysitter, yo yo yo (yo yo)
Yo yo
