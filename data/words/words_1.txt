's

up

i

up

that
made

's
inherited
mine

is
fine

's

they
support
us

maybe
shout
'em
out
in

up

'em
we

'em

up

their

is
worth
more

i
ai

tryna
have
none

hurt

just

somehow
it

the
more
it
backfires

all
the
things
growin

up

daddy
that
he
had
to
see
daddy
do
n't
want
you

you
see
just
as
much
as
he
did
we
did
not
plan
it
to
be
this
way
,
your

me
but
things
have
got
so
bad
between
us
,
i
do
n't
see
us
ever
bein'
together
ever
again
,
like
we
used
to
be
when
we
was
teenagers
but
then
,
of
course
,
everything
always
happens
for
a
reason
i
guess
it
was
never
meant
to
be
,
but
it
's
just
something
we
have
no
control
over
,
and
that
's
what
destiny
is
but
no
more
worries
,
rest
your
head
and
go
to
sleep
maybe
one
day
we
'll
wake
up
and
this
'll
all
just
be
a
dream

[
verse

]
it
's
funny
,
i
remember
back
one
year
when
daddy
had
no
money
mommy
wrapped
the
christmas
presents
up
and
stuck
'em
under
the
tree
and
said
some
of
'em
were
from
me
'cause
daddy
could
n't
buy
'em
i
'll
never
forget
that
christmas
,
i
sat
up
the
whole
night
cryin'
'cause
daddy
felt
like
a
bum—see
,
daddy
had
a
job
but
his
job
was
to
keep
the
food
on
the
table
for
you
and
mom
and
at
the
time
,
every
house
that
we
lived
in
either
kept
gettin
'
broken
into
and
robbed
or
shot
up
on
the
block
and
your
mom
was
savin
'
money
for
you
in
a
jar
tryin
'
to
start
a
piggy
bank
for
you
so
you
could
go
to
college
almost
had
a
thousand
dollars
,
'til
someone
broke
in
and
stole
it
and
i
know
it
hurt
so
bad
it
broke
your
momma
's
heart
and
it
seemed
like
everything
was
just
startin
'
to
fall
apart
mom
and
dad
was
arguin
'
a
lot
,
so
momma
moved
back
on
to
chalmers
in
the
flat
,
one
bedroom
apartment
and
dad
moved
back
to
the
other
side
of
8
mile
on
novara
and
that
's
when
daddy
went
to
california
with
his
cd
and
met
dr.
dre
and
flew
you
and
momma
out
to
see
me
but
daddy
had
to
work
,
you
and
momma
had
to
leave
me
then
you
started
seein
'
daddy
on
the
tv
,
and
momma
did
n't
like
it
and
you
and
lainie
were
too
young
to
understand
it
papa
was
a
rolling
stone
,
momma
developed
a
habit
and
it
all
happened
too
fast
for
either
one
of
us
to
grab
it
i
'm
just
sorry
you
were
there
and
had
to
witness
it
first
hand
'cause
all
i
ever
wanted
to
do
was
just
make
you
proud
now
i
'm
sittin
'
in
this
empty
house
just
reminiscin
'
,
lookin
'
at

,
it
just
trips
me
out
to
see
how
much
you
both
have
grown
,
it
's
almost
like
you
're
sisters
now

ca

what
you

you
make

you
make
me
act

'm
like
a
lunatic
,
you
make
me
sick
you
're
truly
the
only
one
who
can
do
this
to
me
you
just
make
me
get
so
crazy
i
go
schizo
,
i
get
so
insane
,
i
just
go
schizophrenic
one
minute
i
wan
na
slit
your
throat
,
the
next
i
wan
na
sex
you
make
me
crazy
,
the
way
we
act
like
two
maniacs
in
the
sack
we
fuck
like
two
jackrabbits
and
maybe
that
's
a
bad
habit
'cause
the
next
day
we
're
right
back
at
it
in
the
same
exact
pattern
what
the
fuck
is
the
matter
with
us
?
we
ca
n't
figure
out
if
it
's
lust
or
it
's
love
what
's
that
that
's
attractin
'
us
to
each
other
?
they
say
that
every
man
grows
up
to
marry
his
own
mother
which
would
explain
why
you
're
such
a
motherfuckin
'
bitch
but
i
stay
and
still
stick
it
out
with
you
even
though
i
just
hit
you
today
but
you
deserve
it
,
you
hit
me
first
and
provoked
me
to
choke
you
just
'cause
i
came
home
late
last
night
crawled
in
bed
and
i
woke
you
but
if
there
's
one
thing
about
you
that
i
admire
it
's
,
baby
because
you
stay
with
me
,
maybe
'cause
you
're
as
crazy
as
i
am
'cause
when
i
look
at
you
i
can
see
an
angel
in
your
eyes
but
if
i
look
deeper
inside
i
see
your
freakish
little
side
like
a
devil
in
disguise
,
you
're
always
full
of
surprises
always
pullin
'
devices
out
your
purse
:
little
vibrators
and
dildoes
you
fucked
yourself
so
much
you
barely
feel
those
anymore
you
're
only
24
,
but
you
're
plenty
more
ma-ture
than
those
other
little
hoes
who
just
act
like
little
girls
like
they
're
in
middle
school
still
you
're
crazy
,
sexy
,
cool
,
chill
and
you
play
your
position
,
you
never
step
outta
line
even
though
i
stay
in
your
business
you
've
always
kept
outta
mine
i
wonder
what
's
on
your
mind
sometimes
they
say
love
is
blind
maybe
that
's
why
the
first
time
i
dotted
your
eye
you
ai
n't
see
the
sign
or
maybe
you
did
,
maybe
you
like
being
shoved
maybe
'cause
we
're
crazy

you
are
the
ink

my

,
what
my
pen
is
to
my
pad
the
moral
,
the
very
fiber
,
the
whole
substance
to
my
rap
you
are
my
reason
for
being
,
the
meaning
of
my
existence
if
it
was
n't
for
you
i
would
never
be
able
to
spit
this
as
intense
as
i
do
,
and
the
irony
is
you
rely
on
me
as
much
as
i
rely
on
you
to
inspire
me
like
you
do
you
provide
me
the
lighter
fluid
,
the
fuel
to
my
fire
you
're
my
entire
supply
:
gas
,
the
match
,

igniter
the
only
way
that
i
am
able

stable
is
you
're
the
legs

if
you
were

break
i
'd
fall

i
'm
always
gon

you

do
n't
need
you
as
much
as
i
really
need
you
so
you
do
n't
use
it
to
your
advantage

you
're
essential

me

you
're
the
air
i
breathe
i
believe
if
you
ever
leave
me
i
'd
probably
have
no
reason
to
be
you
are
the
kim

you
're

the

who
never

still
trying

get
inside

the

cum-wad
from

gets
in

it

off

usually
more
off

one
i
can
fuck
without
a

the

people
do

10

after

had
more
in

two
odd
motherfuckers

just

to
meet
at

can
change
the
path
that
you
must
go
believe

as
i
believe
in

when
i
think
of
home
,
i
think
of
a
place
where
there
's
love
overflowing
i
wish
i
was
home
,
i
wish
i
was
back
there
with
the
things
i
been
knowing
wind
that
makes
the
tall
grass
bend
into
leaning
suddenly
the
raindrops
that
fall
have
a
meaning
sprinklin
'
the
scene
,
makes
it
all
clean
maybe
there
's
a
chance
for
me
to
go
back
there
now
that
i
have
some
direction
it
would
sure
be
nice
to
be
back
home
where
there
's
love
and
affection
and
just
maybe
i
can
convince
time
to
slow
up
giving
me
enough
time
in
my
life
to
grow
up
time
be
my
friend
,
let
me
start
again
suddenly
my
world
has
changed
it
's
face
but
i
still
know
where
i
'm
going
i
have
had
my
mind
spun
around
in
space
and
yet
i
've
watched
it
growing
if
you
're
listening
god
please
do
n't
make
it
hard
to
know
for
us
to
believe
in
the
things
that
we
see
tell
us
should
we
run
away
or
should
we
try
and
stay
?
or
would
it
be
better
just
to
let
things
be
?
living
here
,
in
this
brand
new
world
might
be
a
fantasy
but
it
taught
me
to
love
so
it
's
real
,
real
to
me
and
i
've
learned
that
we
must
look
inside
our
hearts
to
find
a
world
full
of
love
like
yours
,
like
mine
,
like
home

wonder
why
[

i
had

i
live
in
fear
and
destitution
there's
someone

in
my
reflection
i
do
n't
recognize
i
found
the
dream

i
was
blind

i
'm
looking
for
a
second
chance
before
i
lose
my
mind
climb
the
devil
's
tower
one
more
time
and
like
a
shot
time
rushes
by
how
many
summers
till
i
die
?
now
i
'm
a
man
of
resolution
no
longer
making
all
the
same
mistakes
anymore
i
found
the
dream

i
was

to
fall
in

with
everyone
who
passes
by
although
she
says
she
cares
when
she
does
it
does
n't
show
frozen
smile
she
gave
this
time
she
can
yes

she
can

no
it
's
a
fearful
heart
that
would
let
go
finally
free
so
many
years
and
separate
lives
it
could
be
our
time
make
up
your
