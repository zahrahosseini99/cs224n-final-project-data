where
did
we
go
wrong
i
thought
that
we
were
supposed
to
make
it
where
did
we
go
wrong
how
could
life
give
us
love
,
then
take
it
away
alone
again
today
remembering
when
we
were
a
brand
new
morning
we
were
n't
afraid
to
feel
all
that
we
asked
was
somewhere
to
hide
we
were
like
happy
children
reaching
out
to
touch
everything
that
's
real
we
believed
in
love
'cause
our
lives
were
touching
inside
and
baby
,
remember
the
things
we
needed
the
summers
and
the
winters
and
springs
we
needed
the
feeling
we
would
fly
and
on
wings
we
needed
to
share
remember
the
people
how
few
we
needed
we
always
had
the
me
and
the
you
we
needed
if
every
little
thing
that
we
knew
we
needed
to
care
was
there
then
where
did
we
go
wrong
and
is
n't
time
supposed
to
heal
me
?
where
did
we
go
wrong
and
can
a
part
of
you
still
feel
me
as
much
as
yesterday
a
touch
a
world
away
we
were
the
time
of
crystal
shining
for
love
to
see
both
of
us
gave
the
things
we
receive
we
were
like
hungry
people
as
i
gave
to
you
so
you
gave
to
me
believing
in
our
love
'cause
we
love
the
things
we
believe
baby
,
remember
the
dreams
we
needed
the
nights
we
could
n't
sleep
and
these
dreams
we
needed
so
we
could
find
the
time
for
what
it
seems
we
needed
to
say
remember
the
touches
to
show
we
needed
to
keep
our
love
and
keep
our
love
the
glow
we
needed
and
being
here
without
you
i
know
we
needed
to
stay
that
way
but
where
did
we
go
wrong
i
thought
that
we
were
supposed
to
make
it
where
did
we
go
wrong
how
could
life
give
us
love
,
then
take
it
away
where
did
we
go
wrong
i
thought
that
we
were
supposed
to
make
it
where
did
we
go
wrong
where
did
we
go
wrong
where
did
we
go
wrong
where
did
we
go
wrong
well
early
in
the
morning
,
about
the
break
of
day
i
ask
the
lord
,
``
help
me
find
the
way
!
''

me
find
the
way
to
the
promised
land

lonely
body
needs
a
helping
hand

me
safely
to

you
changed

your

that

why
you
lost
your

you
fell

stay
dapper
and
never
try
to
look

just
fulfill

i

a-blowing
in

the

it
used

sound
through

call
you

me

we
had
it
all

touch
my

reaching
for
a

was
always
there

sat
in

lived
through
the
winter

gone
through

for
fear

i

be
with
you

spare
you
the
grief

'd
live

crisis
and
confusion
when
she
came
along
followed
by
delusion
when
i
found
out
that
i
was
wrong
she
said
``
baby
,
we
're
cruising
along
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
,
''
and
i
said
``
maybe
,
but
baby
i
'm
losing
,
and
the
only
wave
is
goodbye
...
''
'cos
just
when
i
'm
starting
to
burn
with
desire
my
blood
's
getting
hot
and
the
flame
's
rising
higher
she
says
``
goodnight
''
...
and
leaves
me
on
fire
,
and
i
'm
so
sorry
my
love
i
got
ta
say

it
apart
,
ooh

your
light
on
me
for
the
rest
of
the
night
...
scenes
of
soft
seduction
,
spinning
through
my
head
watching
her
deduction
as
i
lay
grinning
on
my
bed
she
said
``
honey
,
it
's
so
moving
,
i
can
almost
see
our
wedding
day
,
''
and
i
said
``
funny
,
you
'd
better
start
grooving
honey
or
the
only
move
is
away
''
...
and
then
she
turned
with
that
look
in
her
eye
and
i
know
that
bad
weather
'll
be
here
by
and
by
and
sure
enough
,
she
started
to
cry
,
and
i
'm
so
sorry

sitting

there
was
a
lonesome
cowboy
,
who
rode
his
horse
all
day
at
night
he
slept
in
the
moonlight
,
till
he
heard
that
midnight
train
...
and
then
that
lonesome
cowboy
,
looked
up
at
the
stars
in
the
sky
''
i
will
leave
my
land
and
my
horses
,
on
that
midnight
train
i
will
ride
to
the
city
,
far
across
the
plains
to
that
city
,
on
that
midnight
train
,
here
it
comes
choo
choo
choo
...
on
that
midnight
train
''
and
then
that
lonesome
cowboy
,
stepped
into
a
bar
a
pretty
girl
slid
over
nice
and
easy
,
``
boy
your
money
wo
n't
go
far
.
''
she
took
him
outside
to
an
alley
,
he
got
dragged
into
a
fight
and
a
bullet
sent
him
dying
,
and
he
cursed
that
moonless
night
in
that
city
,
far
across
the
plains
in
that
city
,
he
could
hear
that
midnight
train
,
down
the
line
;
choo
choo
choo
...
he
could
hear
that
midnight
train
and
now
that
lonesome
cowboy
is
lain
beneath
the
clay
his
horses
they
're
still
waiting
,
for
he
is
gone
away
;
now
if
you
think
the
grass
is
greener
on
the
far
side
of
the
hill
all
you
cowboys
,
take
it
easy
,
there
's
no
grass
there
at
all
in
that
city
,
far
across
the
plains
in
that
city
,
you
'd
better
miss
that
midnight
train
,
here
it
comes
choo
choo
choo
...
you
'd
better
miss
that
midnight
train
choo
choo
choo
...
that
train
is
coming
for
you
where
your
love
is
,
put
your
heart
,
guard
these
moments
well
where
your
dreams
are
,
put
your
hopes
,
you
know
they
will
not
fail
you
when
the
sun
rises
in
the
morning
,
you
will
wake
up
and
find
her
yawning
when
the
wind
blows
strong
and
cold
,
she
'll
be
with
you
until
you
grow
old
where
your
love
is
,
put
your
heart
,
oh
what
would
you
do
if
your
dreams
came
true
?
i
would
build
a
lovely
house
with
satin
green
shutters
,
it
would
be
lovely
the
most
lovely
house
in
the
world
...
and
i
would
sing
a
lovely
song
with
you
in
my
mind
,
and
you
in
my
eyes
the
most
lovely
song
in
the
world
...
i
would
write
it
down
on
the
wall
,
just
for
you
,
just
for
you
;
and
i
would
hold
you
in
my
arms
for
the
rest
of
my
days
when
you
're
sad
and
feeling
low
,
you
're
on
your
own
with
nowhere
to
go
make
believe
that
she
is
gone
,
play
your
guitar
and
write
a
song
for
her
write
down
the
words
about
how
you
cried
when
you
woke
up
weeping
'cos
you
thought
that
she
had
died
,
and
you
heard
her
breathing
through
your
pain
and
you
held
her
close
and
cried
all
over
again
;
where
your
love
is
,
put
your
heart
,
oh
what
would
you
do
if
your
dreams
came
true
?
and
inside
my
lovely
house
with
satin
green
shutters
,
there
would
be
children
the
most
lovely
children
in
the
world
...
and
even
when
skies
are
grey
,
we
would
be
happy
,
for
we
have
love
the
most
lovely
love
in
the
world
;
i
would
write
it
down
on
the
wind
,
just
for
you
,
just
for
you
;
and
i
would
hold
you
in
my
arms
for
the
rest
of
my
days
flying
,
i
thought
i
'd
never
learn
that
flying
i
thought
i
'd
spend
my
whole
life
trying
for
flying
is
that
ancient
art
of
keeping
one
foot
on
the
ground
...
lying
,
i
thought
i
'd
never
keep
from
lying
i
thought
i
'd
lose
it
all
by
sighing
for
lying
is
that
ancient
art
of
hiding
words
that
will
never
be
found
crying
,
i
thought
i
'd
never
stop
that
crying
i
thought
i
'd
always
dream
of
dying
for
crying
is
that
ancient
art
of
weeping
rivers
into
the
ground
oh
dying
,
i
thought
i
'd
never
see
that
dying
i
thought
i
'd
spend
my
whole
life
flying
for
dying
is
that
ancient
art
of
keeping
one
world
turning
round
sighing
,
i
thought
i
'd
never
keep
from
sighing
i
thought
i
'd
always
be
there
crying
for
sighing
is
that
ancient

of
breathing
sadness
all
around
and
trying

i
thought
i
'd
spend
my
seasons
trying

is
...
well
,
it
's
after
midnight
and
the
stars
are
shining
bright
and
a
big
fat
moon
is
dancing
on
the

,
and
i
'm
thinking
,
oh
my
...
and
that
old
man
in
the
sky
he
's
looking
me
right
in
the
eye
and
he
's
wondering
why
,

he
's
saying

why
are
n't
you
sleeping

''
oh
,
the
day
is
hanging
heavy
on
my

i
guess
the
time
has
come
to
say
goodnight
...
and
may
your
dreams
take
you
travelling
all
night
long
with
an
angel
by
your
side
when
the
wind
blows
strong
oh
stay
away
from
that

will
lead
you
to

spent
that
every
lasting
cent
on
someone
that
's
not
your

there
's
bound
to
be
a
chance
to
heal
the
wound
and
start

part
of
it
is
yours

something
for

underneath
the
sun
here

sailing
the

like
a
bird
on
the
breeze
oh
how
she
travelled
far
and
wide
now
she
is
nearly
at
home
not
much
longer
alone
coming
back
on
the
morning
tide
unreleased
:
bring
us
home
,
wind
up
high
in
the
mast
keep
us
safe
,
hold
her
steady
and
fast
(
unreleased
verse
:
)
and
the
people
at
home
have
been
waiting
so
long
through
the
tears
and
the
pain
'cause
they
're
sailing
home
again
bringing
something
for
everyone
from
far-off
lands
underneath
the
sun
here
comes
the
alibama
,
the
alibama
from
over
the
sea
here
comes
