# Introduction
For this project, since I love music and I listen to music most of the day, I decided to work on a music-related topic. Therefore, I want to collect and tag music lyrics.I consider two classes, music is classified into two classes before the 2000s and after the 2000s based on the lyrics.

### Motivation 
I have always believed that the peak of music dates back to before 2000 (I like rock music!), recognizing the decade of music can be a testament to my hypothesis because then the data of the two categories are so different that they can be classified.

### What is Genius?
[Genius](https://genius.com/) is an online community where users browse, rate, and create annotations for lyrics to help explain their meaning and context.
